welcome to my diary, stressing got me gray hairs
something to inspire me, rather than society's
woes, let me go, let me shine a lil' bit love
i want diamonds too, ronnie on player's club
i used to have a nine-to-five, fresh out of school, that was '05
that bitch was racist, got me fired, they rushed us then, i had no job
pushing in my mama van, stop for gas on rosecrans
trust me, these niggas rushed me for something my cousin probably did
guilty by association, story of my life nigga
you gon' make me flip, then split yo' shit, judge give me life nigga
pain since my grandma's death, uncle killed at louie's burgers
hold my tears, i tried my best, let it go, trench my pullover
cycles of a starving artist tryna go beyond the margin-margin
maintaining my modest-modest as i dream
so while i go through all-this-all-this, bullshit what you call it
life itself, i know it helps, let me scroll through my blackberry

i said, keep reading my diary when my life's entirely
surrounded by the irony of living in the city
i said they wouldn't hire me, i said i got my ass beat
and the only thing can help is ass and some titties
so what's up baby i said what's up
i had a long day and i really wanna fuck
see i ain't tryna think about no phone bills, credit card late fees
capital one popping up on my caller id
pawning my chain in the shop, watching for hollow tip shots
watching my vehicle break down on another man's block
man, that's my worst fear, ain't that your worst fear
you know when your transmission go out and can't switch gears
or run through a pothole at two in the morning
scared to hit your emergencies, cause then they'll be on it
see i know, when the harsh reality takes toll
open up your contacts, then scroll hey what's up daddy

one time
reporting live, compton, california

she go to work, she go to school
her body smooth, no tattoos
type of girl that make your mother feel comfortable
my pops love her too, she's compatible
she's independent, she handle her business
she believe in god and no other religions
never in competition when it comes to her friends
she's dependable, she set her own trends
a confidant, a mediator
so sweet, every flavor
just a conversation with her, doing you a favor
look at her hips, i want to be her pager
conservative, affirmative
action when she relaxing in sweats and bobby pins
the beauty of her, a blind man could see
a true queen, and she needs me
she needs me, she needs me
she needs me, she needs me
the beauty of her, swear to god a blind man could see
a true queen, and she needs me

five years later, an accounting major
work at a firm, abundance of paper
she got a career, she look in the rear-
view mirror of a mercedes that she can steer
private bars, executive meetings
consecutive trips, vacation on weekends
dior reeking through her prada dress
probably the only product of a pure success
got a promotion, now she own the building
headed to the top like she on the building
real estate, property
she do tender steak, only one mouth to feed
funded a youth center, invested in some stock
doubled what she put in, then bought a restaurant
oh what a girl, how great life can be
and though she got the world, she needs me
she needs me, she needs me
she needs me, she needs me
oh what a girl, wonder how her life can be
and though she got the world, she needs me

we lose touch, separated
years pass, i'm out dating
she's dating, one of hollywood's
famous of entertainers, denzel good
paparazzi spot 'em out shopping
tuesday morning brunch, benihana's
tabloids paint the picture of a perfect couple
headline reads, when a famous actor loves you
emmy awards, academy too
on the red carpet, dress matching his suit
she holding his arm, she wave at her moms
then wave at the world, got the world in her palms
head in the clouds, star-gazing
caught her on the stage, a proposal was waiting
he bent down, got on one knee
she looked him in the eye, and said she needs me
she needs me, she needs me
she needs me, she needs me
even if we seem to separate, eventually
it'll come to pass, and she'll need me
i need her we need we

see y'all don't understand me
my plan be is to win y'all hearts before i win a grammy
kendrick lamar, words like a sword in the hands of a spartan
marching on rosecrans in compton
you can't cause conflict or corrupt my spirit
i'm on point like period
i've been there and gone before you get near it
ooh wee, that young boy remind me of a young martin luther
the way he piece up troopers, then round up shooters
like malcolm x did, i stand for what i believe in
family, god and honor
from chicago, my daddy and my momma
came to compton to accomplish one thing
raise a king, reign supreme, named kendrick
i ain't lying, it stand for king and i am one
my unborn son and grandson will live royal
from the coochie to the soil
the meek shall inherit the earth
well i've had this world since birth
feel the good kid's hunger
the crips made strong, the pirus made stronger
muscle in my heart
stare at the eyes of mozart, then tell him i'm the genius
do my dougie and grab my penis
cause i means this with all my soul
and you can't control greatness 'less you hating with the heart of satan
but even that can't stop it
nigga, get out my wallet and put passion in your logic
passion in your life, the passion of my christ is in me
and if you say it ain't, you may offend me
damn that boy good
bright as thomas edison, but gucci mane hood
he stood alone for so long
prolonged his whole career, but now he's here
you can shoot shots or cheer cause i am

it's like i don't think you fully understand who i am, y'know
i'm just a good kid from compton that wanna rap
i don't represent no colors, i represent my lil' sisters and brothers
i'm the oldest, nigga
and if you can't respect that, your whole perspective is wack
check it out

i used to wanna rap like jay-z
until i finally realised that jay wasn't me
i took my time to jot down every line that's a quotable
critics say i don't be killing this shit but i know i do
because i used to practice early morning and then after school
i'm working on my hooks my nigga, i ain't tryna battle you
but even if i did, i guarantee i'd overshadow you
like a fucked up taper that turned to bowl cut
i'ma close cut to common and gucci mane
now that's a comparison that you probably wouldn't understand
because i can touch the people and still keep it ghetto
as an '87 regal with the tree air freshener on the rearview mirror
i wear a heart on my shoulder
'member when we used to make the boost look like motorola
your cousin fucked up your room every time he came over
then went to jail when we got older
that shit is a bad odor, but still i remain focussed
in due time, i'll be able to swipe my card and it won't say decline
that shit's embarrassing huh
hope no one pay you no mind
but it's a bad bitch behind you while you standing in line
can you relate to my story can you follow my dreams
and admirations that i had ever since i was thirteen
my momma believed in me, she let me use her van to go to the studio
even though she know her tank is empty, that's who i do it fo'
my pops got a different approach, yeah he believed
but he always questioned when i'ma drop my debut cd
how long this gon' take nigga you still haven't ate nigga
at twenty-two i had two cars and my own place nigga
it's a sacrifice i try to tell him
that's when he turn to bet and tell me that he jealous
of all these niggas getting money and their shit don't sound like shit
i ain't tryna kill your confidence or forcing you to quit
i just wanna hear you heard

what up dasan i ain't forgot nigga
you developed me, telling me i was hot nigga
you believed in me first, that's what's for sure
at the church recording, at the garage, but it worked
but me and dave kind of felt you lost the passion
a lot was going on in your life and you needed space
but still i should have came to you first to tell you what happened
but i was seventeen and figured it's best i stay away
and i wrong, i was young and couldn't look you in the eye for what i'd done
but i'm telling you we ain't done
matter of fact, how's your sons what they up to
remember they used to run around while you had worked on protools
people i used to be in the booth till four in the morning
with school in the morning, yawning, but i was on it
me, you and dave was on it
buzzing like charlotte hornets when that tape dropped
where them beats nigga it's been five years since we had rocked
time to be heard

so can you feel it
when you hear it do it pulsate your spirit
do it make you wanna say motherfuck a gimmick
the truth can set you free if you do the right thing
word to spike lee, don't he look like sounwave
that's kinda random, but my humor sometimes strays, like a dog in the night
twenty-four hours in a day but only take five minutes
to grab a pad and a pen, then send your dog a kite
i spread love like a hippy, but i'm a black one
with jesus christ passion, i swear on the bible
tabernacle to all my rivals, i ain't mad
you hate a nigga for tryna help you, that's your bad
because i figure i can make a way with these stanzas
i probably can't heal cancer, but i can heal the city
my niggas, tell me you with me
and if you is won't you pop my cd in
open up your trunk, then let it bump, so i can be heard
yeah, uh huh

d-dave, what up nigga
matt jeezy

the homies say i'm the truest
the bitches think i'm the cutest

thank god for these rap recordings

5-0-1s, louis letterman jacket
little brother only five, momma put him on my taxes
you know that compton ghetto shit
that every section 8 tenant is familiar with ooh wee
they say he something like the seventies, but i'm from '87
with a thousand dimes, you got eighty sevens
gourmet sneakers, hair nappy
fucking all my high school teachers, that was '05 bro
and i don't like 'em if the ass thin
and i don't wife 'em if a nigga is her best friend
the fuck i look like
a billion bucks, and that's why

the homies say i'm the truest
the bitches think i'm the cutest
the definition what cool is
boy, i thought you knew this

she looking at the car like she wanna fuck it
she looking at the wrist like she wanna fuck it
hating on her girlfriend just so i can fuck it
she say she on birth control, no i don't trust it, hoe
uh, so give me fifty feet champ
run until i got a bunion and my feet cramp
i'm in the hot spot, i know they seats damp
and i don't need your cosign, that's a cheap stamp
you nix check cashing
i'm gt crashing, 1-0-5 off ramp
ay, that lil' nigga got it going on
g5, going-going-going gone
cloud nine mind state

a-b-c-d-e-f-g, fuck, skip to y

bitch i do this
bitch i do this
the definition what cool is
boy, i thought you knew this
bitch i do this

i was sitting on the couch, reading yellow paper
a letter in reply, seven days later
after i wrote him stay strong, keep your faith in god
what i told him, hoping that he's listening
said that they tried to give him like a hundred years
what a coincidence, i was bumping some plies
i can taste the salt from my tears
as the water had start to flood on my eyes
i know it gotta be hard being twenty-one
doing time in the pen and your gramp's old
your brother's getting older, and the streets is getting colder
and you're hoping that he's focussed to stay on the right road
sleeping in a cell, it's been thirty weeks
ain't received any mail, it's cold and the hole stinks
and you can't even blink without niggas testing your life
as i read every word that you write, i can only imagine
jason keaton, i can only imagine, yeah

sitting on the couch, that was my uncle bobby
after he just got out, fifteen years to count
haven't seen the world in so long, haven't seen a girl in so long
and before the sun came up, he was gone
like a fiend off the best rock
trying to get his life together, or whatnot
typed his name in the system and they couldn't find his identity
got it straight, got a place, found some serenity
found a job, found his mother gravesite, found a forty ounce
then he found god, then he bounced
then he found a new chick, two kids, wide hips
found something in her we didn't see
found this spot in pasadena and shacked with her, an investment
then found guilty, somebody had yelled domestic
violence on my uncle, was working with two strikes
only out a year, now facing life, i can only imagine
that's fucked up, i can only imagine, uncle bob

sitting on the couch, thinking bout the ratio
of blacks in prison, it's compact in prison
when blacks packed with minorities, system grab more of these
eighteen-year-olds, eighteen-year sentence
with no parole, the state won't oversee
they make the term severe, a conspiracy
that's what i call it, it's full of shit, a toilet can help quick
the government help no, just put us on death row
just give us some more guns, then give us some more coke
then give us another chair, then give us some more rope
then hang it like right there, yeah, it's justice for all
but ninety-percent unfair, care nah
alcatraz was purchased by a white man for five grand
with intentions to expand, more prisons
so these correctionals ain't for rehabilitation
they for grossing a bigger business, imagine
we being used, imagine, the truth shall be told

cloud nine, kendrick lamar, uh
i take a sip of hennessy and then get pissy drunk
i ain't a drinker, i'm a thinker, call it what you want
but if you turn your back, know that you just missed your chance
to witness the realest shit that's ever been told to man
i found myself losing focus at a sunday service
embarrassed so i started questioning god, what is my purpose
he say to live the way he did, that's all he want from me
spread the word and witness, he rose on the first sunday
i said alright, enthused that my lord gave a listen
i opened my bible and searched to be a better christian
and this from a person that never believed in religion
but shit, my life is so fucked up man, i can't help but give in
i'm giving testimonies to strangers i never met
hopped on the pulpit and told 'em how i was truly blessed
felt like i'm free from all my sins when the service was over
walked out the church, then got a call that my homie was murdered
and lost my faith again

single black parent from compton raising children of four
that's four innocent bastards, cause papa they don't know
her day consists of working back and forth with babysitters
can't find no one to watch her kids so she pay her sister
her baby daddy ain't bout shit, that nigga ain't bout shit
spent his daughter milk just to cop a new outfit
she pray to god every night hoping that he'll mature
and maybe one day his kids, something that he'll live for
baby wanna go back to school but she need some help
because it's hard tryna pay the bills when you're by yourself
she thought about credit card scams till she heard a voice
that said the devil is a lie, make a better choice
and so it's back to mcdonald's and every month dealing
with them crazy ass people at the county building
looked to the heavens and asked 'em to make a better way
then got a letter in the mail, lost her section 8
then lost her faith again

this for my people that stressing whenever times is hard
your mind's slipping, wondering is there really a god
knowing you shouldn't think that way and tryna freeze your brain
but whenever it's pain, that feeling forever remains
we can't believe what we can't see and reality seems stronger than prayer
cause you tried to change your life, and now you live in a wheelchair
and your son was born with cancer and he live in urgent care
at the tender age of twelve, and you feel that no one cares
searching for answers, that's human nature, you ain't in the wrong
just know, when you feeling that way his spirit's in the room
i watched people i know pray and catch the holy ghost
and wonder why i ain't never caught that feeling before
maybe they know him better, or i don't know no better
but what i do know is that he's real and he lives forever
so the next time you feel like your world's about to end
i hope you studied because he's testing your faith again

i'd rather not live like there isn't a god
than die and find out there really is, think about it

uh, coming down like i'm uphill
hogging both lanes better than a bus will
she tell me that my head bigger than a bus wheel
but it don't matter cause she still gon' let me fuck still
i mix a little bit of kendrick with some la weather
then step out like chicago in its finest era
you niggas begging for attention, doing extra-extra
downgrading yourself, you get an f for effort
ha-ha, i let the world know
i chose to keep to myself and let the world go
and if you don't like a nigga, then let your girl know
so she can be curious on twitter looking me up
i'm laid back with a bad one, you ain't never had one
ass so fat that it tipped over the aston
speeding on the 1-0-5 till the fucking badge come
hello to my wittiness, i'm cadillac's grandson

landing on another runway, fly with me
or die tryna fly, a shot-down frisbee
shout out to black hippy, nigga we on
like we never been off, straight shots of patron
i'm give y'all the business to give y'all some business
pussy ain't shit, i can give y'all some bitches
clean off her sports bra, she clean off my dishes
then wear off the kangols, hood rats, i hate those
and she know what this is, hey lil' mama
seen your pretty ass around the way lil' mama
but why you always in somebody face lil' mama
embarrassing yourself, get off the stage lil mama
nigga, i gotta be that nigga
if i ain't, i gotta be that nigga
curtesy of paula's oldest son, pay homage
or pay attention, open your eyes and hear knowledge

gi-give me that, gi-gi-give me that
that's how i get at 'em when i look at a shoe rack
penny for thoughts, mine start at a few racks
so i can live on a hill just off a few raps
i want to live in a space that none of y'all can visit
that might be outer space, the jupiter district
i quadruple my vision
if you don't see it then you're dead with your eyes open
i've seen bullets hit the wheel, left his ride smoking
on some compton shit
somebody that'll ride or die, that's a compton bitch
you see my city is the city of lamar
it'll take twenty years 'fore a nigga see them all
the swap meet dumping, the sawed-off pumping
the tree for the low, don't you know, paul bunyan
i'm on cloud nine, i can see rain coming
so if i'm out my mind, people don't say nothing

uh-uh-uh, what up
uh, i'm tryna, what up
uh-uh, i'm tryna get something
uh-uh-uh, i'm tryna, what up
i say, what up
uh-uh, i'm tryna

sometimes i wanna leave, sometimes i wanna cry
sometimes i hate to bear the truth, sometimes i wanna lie
sometimes i wanna school the youth, sometimes i wanna ride
sometimes i wanna not think, sometimes i wanna vibe
sometimes i wanna bump tribe and zone out, this song bout a young boy
that's going wild inside, when my world collide
with your world where your girl and your kids reside
we kill the facades, we feel free to fly
we're birds that reserve in the charismatic sky
i care about my pride too much, if my clothes is new
if my ride is plush, if my hair is cut, if my diamonds is crushed
i look in the mirror, i'm trendy enough wrong
insecurity roams the black community
homes where kids must have jewelry
the high school female need earrings and details
so she can be cool to be amongst popularity
the various name brands that reach the price scan
that's not about the right price, but more like the right scam
to rule us all, confuse us all
hit the bank within five minutes and then withdraw
now let's draw the picture of a rapper with a chain
in a range that is not paid for
my cousin from the south said he just bought him a house
that lives around his neck like a white collar
so why fast forward then i rewind
a time machine can help me double back to slavery times
picking cotton from a field that a white man own
the blacker you are, farther you from the white man's home
negro spiritual zones gave us some type of sanity
before your vanity they parted our families
they put us in hundred-degree shade, and outside we bathed
the more we were afraid, the more they made rules
and trapped our minds in the cage, our freedom was so fake
couldn't see it with the eyes of tracee ross, uh
and school was exempt, see we couldn't have smarts
and a smirk could get you hurt, wound diversed from a scar
four-hundred years of nothing, four-hundred years of suffering
four-hundred years of tears and tribulation, miseducation
see what we facing is now coming, back to the roots
remember whips on our back and if we would run they would shoot
call us niggers and figured that we'd never lived in pursuit
of happiness, we captured these feelings in things that we do
thought it's abstinence in slavery, but we made it come to
a modern perspective, my shoe selection gotta be louie
her handbag gotta be gucci, it's fake then she foobie
she still bad though, and her fake gucci ain't that bad though
we filling up the gas for rollies
upgrade to twenty-sixes, out there riding kobes
my cousin from the south, slavery start in the south and i bet ya
he overcompensates for the life of his ancestors
so blame it on the four-hundred years we never saw
the reason why the next four-hundred we gotta floss
slaves

uh, i say the four-hundred years we never had nothing
barely had clothes on our back
it's the reason why when we get a little bit of change
we over-exaggerate on our living expenses
so if you get your first big check and you cop a chain before you buy a house
you're a vanity slave
if you're a female and you got four, five, six rings on your finger
four holes in your left ear and a nose piercing
you're a vanity slave
if you got an '02 monte carlo with twenty-fo's on it
and on the back of the window it says get on my level hoe
you're a vanity slave
we all vanity slaves
and with that being said, can somebody please tell me where the mall at
i'm not from around here
hey ali, where we at idaho
yeah nigga, you know the first of the month
you know them checks come in
i'm tryna get something, but what up

a nigga so goddamn stressed out
i feel like fuck everything right now
see i've been broke too long, can't find a job to save my life
but i'll be damned if i give 'em a handout
see my pride is one thing i will not put aside
i'm too proud to beg, i'm sorry left eye
if i don't make it in life, motherfucker i tried
what uh

you ever feel like nobody never understands you but you
not your momma, your poppa, only person is you
not your brother, your sister, the only person is you
you ever feel like nobody never understands you but you
nobody, nobody but you
so it feels like, like it's only you

so i'm feeling like i want to, i want to
i want to, i want to go so far from here
very, very far from here
i need to, i need to
i need to, i need to go so far from here
very, very far from here

it seems like, you can't win for losing
whatever you're doing turns out to be what-are-you-doing
sitting pursuing, but your time will soon come
nobody knows the position that you in
but it's a million people out there that's going through the same thing
that feeling, hard to explain
when you just, just want to get away
something like

reporting live, from compton, california
north cackalack

now everybody just bow to the greatness, or die in the matrix
you're hereby dating, my destiny's waiting
my itinerary is very hectic
i break records on every record, i'm truly reckless
kendrick lamar, no audemars on my wrist
just arthritis from holding it down bitch
me and my down bitch, get busy
i'm busy taking over, the world
with the weight of the world on my shoulder
my drive is not to be chauffeured
i'm live, come to the harvest, welcome the artist
whose lyrics out of the orbit, more than the hardest rapper
to hit the market and market myself as a shooting target
with offers that got me up in these offices often
boo-yaa, boo-yaa, no one, i've done situated myself, i ain't lying
be sure to be friend cause my foes die five times
the good kid from the mad city
holding a cereal box instead of a glock
in a 1992 caddilac that i got from my pops
transmission slipping, but i ain't tripping, swallow my pride
pop in my tape and roll the window, down
like stacie homie when airing out endo
i wish a nigga would

a yes yes y'all, and you don't stop
a yes yes y'all, and you don't stop
a yes yes y'all, and you don't stop
kendrick, show these muh'fuckers how we rock
a yes yes y'all, and you don't stop
a yes yes y'all, and you don't stop
a yes yes y'all, and you don't stop
big pooh, show these muh'fuckers how we rock

me and big pooh like the definition of a two-man city zoo
even zeus can beat up from punchlines
when i kick it and pump mine, i've got to be a prophet
i've gotta make a profit big enough to have a thirty pound wallet
i'm a hub city representer, so i've got to represent the
city like a district attorney being the case for killers
might walk around in gurney, this is my sickest winter
since i had the flu and flew in the hospital with the shivers

we on ali you ugly
everybody just clap your hands if you're real
middle finger up, give a fuck how they feel
be yourself, just show me you're real
middle fingers up

uh, i just wanna be me
no disrespect, but motherfuck you
my education stopped at a high school degree
but i can outsmart any high iq
draped in some fly shit, call me jeff goldblum
cold, my style making my nose run
oh, i stare at the mirror, then realize
that real lies, within me
some say i'm crazy cause i think like i need a shrink
ask too many questions about the stars and earth shit
rather be in the studio than out buying drinks
so if i'm not clubbing, don't think i'm on some jerk shit
and california on that jerk shit
but i'd just rather two-step like my first steps
jill scott in my ipod as my head rests, yes

and yeah i know i'm from compton, cali'
but i don't lace up chucks or rock tan khakis
and skinny jeans ain't quite the lick
i probably would wear 'em but my dick don't fit
ha-ha-ha, i like to joke, got a sense of humor
stale face, play me short like an oompa-loompa
you ain't gotta screw up your face in front of the kids
won't you lighten up like michael did
i grew up with killers man, people who killed man
but my character never could be like them man
and they respect that, say that i'm real man
not a fake person, that's the sims man
live my life through some film man
i ain't acting out shit, i be packing out shows
cause they know they'll know kendrick fo' sho'  and oh

almost lost my life to the industry
had to look through a photo book to remember me
these label heads ain't nothing but bullshit
have you with professional killers, chasing hits
lying to yourself all over an image
making records they want, that was wrecking my brilliance
my mama said, boy that don't sound like you
i said, this is the sound though, my only excuse
quite frankly, dusted off my shoes with my hankie
and kicked it like he skate, make these motherfuckers hate me
the reason why they hate, cause these motherfuckers ain't me
and you can underrate me, but i know what i'm worth
a diamond in god's dirt, a diamond in winter
watching simpsons and eating some cereal for dinner
see i give you my life to mix it up in a blender
to make sure that you feel it

i think that i finally reached the pinnacle
of finding myself as an individual
the world is so typical
i just wanna be higher than that
i used to want to be the messiah of rap
infatuated with becoming a relevant star
trying to say goodbye to the glamorous chains and cars
that i never had, but wrote it in my raps to make you mad
vanity, they say that it can damage me
so do i really want it
if i didn't, i guess i'm a cool cocaine connect
that means i'll be fronting, hmm
cooking in a laboratory, hoping i can tell a story
that the whole world can feel, like the ones that came before me
knowing that i'm misunderstood
so i gotta get my point across like a snitch would
and i would never walk in the shadow that never was really there
or try to fill the shoes of an invisible pair
and dame said he proud of my newfound honesty
and all i could say is, will the radio care
yeah, or should i say no
or should i just stop and come with a whole new approach
you heard my hip hop when i was sixteen years old
well that was me then, now i'm an adult
twenty-two like the smallest of guns that you know, most determined
but with the smallest of funds to show, but i'm not worried
my talent should take me places i've never been
the world should turn soon as my record spin
i wanna be the highest, on top of all the bullshit
the negative you bring, the stress, the violence
the capital punishment, the loud police sirens
too focussed, one word, righteous
and this is kendrick lamar
and soon y'all know cloud nine y'all
and that means i wanna be the highest
too focussed, one word righteous
mm, yeah
that means i wanna be the highest
too focussed, one word

go getter, with no cheddar
just a white tee and a swap meet sweater
my life is likely to see great endeavors
but i can't win if i can't get it together
what i gotta do in order to see success
having the world's best to call me the best
pull up at the grammy awards as best-dressed
with an address next to a beautiful actress
a dollar and a dream, i feel j cole
word to the hole in my pocket and the hoes
that don't wanna fuck with a broke nigga with ambition
but the last i checked, y'all was broke bitches
make a name for myself
then bubble like the ass of buffy when she wearing a tight belt
the homies on the block can say whatever they say
i don't wanna be a killer, i wanna be a gates

what i gotta do in order to see success
having the world's best to call me the best
pull up at the grammy awards as best-dressed
with an address next to a beautiful actress
do i gotta run in your spot and start blasting
better yet, rob the nearest nix check cashing
hear a hustle from a nigga that's constantly bragging
catch him at the light, snatch him out his jeep wagon
or maybe i gotta hook up with jose
cop five bricks of the yay, head to the bay
area, or carry the birds to the gate
let the clips distribute the work all day
then come back home
every three weeks, flip three-to-six zones
homies on the block can say whatever they want
i don't wanna be a dealer, i wanna be a trump
donald that is

and when i do it, i do it again, then i go back
when i do it, i'll do it again, then i go back
thug it out, but for now i'm willing to dug it out
i gotta grind, grind

so welcome to the story of my life
see i'm tryna get right off the shit that i write
make a fortune, buy some porsches for my momma and the wife
pop's engine in this old school run tight
but as you listening to k d-o-t
me and my girl split the bucket at kfc
she listening to drake and all i can say
damn, these niggas that much better than me
baby, i don't think this is meant to be
cause i'm always losing self-esteem
she paused the iphone, then said huh
i repeated what i said, then she replied shut up
you know you the best boy, you gotta keep doing it
but don't forget when you do, just keep you in it
and never listen to what the industry say
don't be a typical artist, be more like jay
russell, barry gordy, quincy jones
bob johnson, sean combs, la reid
young black entrepreneurs did what it took to succeed, yeah
so i gotta see success
i gotta make it off them rosecrans steps
rising to the top like a soda shook up
bout to pop, and i'll pop on whoever's in my way

yeah, i swear to god i don't wanna do it, just live man
i wanna live good
just wanna make my momma proud, y'know
i don't wanna be hard, i don't want the most stripes
i got lil' brothers and sisters man, i'm the oldest nigga
i just want it, i just want it
and i'ma get it

thank you
sitting in the studio thinking about which mood would go
right now, freestyle or write down, whatever
and still i come up clever, i just need to free my thoughts
and lord knows that i know better, but i ain't perfect
i ain't seen too many churches or know them testament verses
you should either hear me now or go deaf
or end up dead, die trying and know death
might end up dead, swallow blood, swallow my breath
fuck a funeral, just make sure you pay my music respect nigga
i mean that from the bottom of my heart
you see my art is all i have, and victory tastes sweet
even when an enemy can throw salt
still knock 'em out the park like a fucking tow car
let bygones be bygones, but where i'm from
we buy guns and more guns to give to the young
i'm living the life of a nigga trapped, nigga
inside the system, all you envision is trap niggas
my uncle doing life inside prison, he wasn't wrapped too tight
he told me rap about life, not rap, niggas
that's why i'm shaking my head when you rap dissing
my stomach start turning, my nerves get to twitching
i start evaluating, then my final intuition
is that you wishing a come up, would just come up
we used to beefing over turf, fuck beefing over a verse
niggas dying, motherfuck a double entendre
and this is compton, lions in the land of the triumph
wrap saran our defiance, ban our alliance
put burners in the hands of the black man
one hood with twenty fo'-fo's like a cloned kobe bryant
you probably heard i wanna be heard and wonder who i am
you probably even listened to faith and think i know zion
but really i'm just caught in the loop of understanding the truth
because it seem like it's always clashing with science
i got a big fear of flying
my future so bright i'd probably go blind before i blink twice, i ain't lying
i swear to god, half of y'all cats just don't know kendrick
the school of hard knocks, we was the first ones in attendance
you walking down the block, he got shot, you are no eyewitness
you just mind your bidness
you just turn your head, kneel down, and then tie your tennis
it's kinda scary ain't it
you can't act like no bitch, that only got tyler perry famous
just let me explain it, why you pick up that stainless
cause your pops wasn't anxious to see you when you hated him
so much, you probably had your burner tucked at graduation
said if you'd see him on them bleachers then you'd kill him, facing
twenty-five to life with a murder charge
your enemies was the prey, and now you pray to god
i pray these bars get farther than compton
and if my record never break i still won't break my promise, i promise to keep it honest
secret society, all we ask is trust
and all we lack is communication like service sucks
the people scared of annihilation when kingdom come
and i'm like, the kendrick lamar od in less than a month
alright gotta keep it pushing
can't let the government tell me how my future looking
i'm on rosecrans   central tryna duck the central bookings
if the fucking pigs get behind me then you know i'm bucking, never will i surrender
i've been a warrior when i came out of my mom's placenta
in the gutter lane like i'm master splinter
how splendid, i guess my project had did it
got all these niggas approaching they mixtapes different
they said seven tracks, i said fifteen
called it an ep, they said i'm tripping
but little did they know, i'm tryna change the rules
that we've been confined to, so the corporate won't make decisions
uppity bitches, handling bidness
killing our dreams, stealing our vision
out in haiti adolescents barely have a home
in la everybody think they fucking on
hop on twitter, perpetrate, we doing big shit
who we hanging with, and bragging about the iphone
i swear to god, most of y'all cats just don't know kendrick
you barely know yourself, so i guess most of y'all should be offended
ain't doing this for my health, i'm tryna purchase my momma them benzes
occupy my time with riches, justify my time, ambition's
just to coincide, just to go inside books we idolize while we living
look the mastermind, took the master's mind, just the perfect time just to master mine
just to master grind with precision, look the mastermind, took the

smoke to it nigga, smoke to it nigga

that's what she said to me
that place i used to call home is just a bed to me
and we don't even sleep, neighbors can hear her weep
meanwhile i'm in these streets with everybody
i'm trying to get it and she know they got me, i watch her feelings watch me
as they staring with the saddest eyes of loneliness
look each other in the face and barely blink
i tried to make it right but the pen ran out of ink
so if my letters don't reach you, i hope these lyrics in sync

that's what it said to me
but that place i call ambition now dead to me
gone and forgotten, i'm off track like dale earnhardt
my liver rotten, alcoholic tripping
fucking bad bitches and they got bad intentions
club night, guys and dolls
balling out, but i'm bout to drop the ball
i'm calling out for help, my engineer called
told me come to the studio, i wanna tell him nah

that's what he said to me
but that place we call heaven unfair to me
only a hundred and forty-four can go
seven billion people on planet earth today
is there something that i don't know
i know to follow him, rather following people
or follow vanity cause that means i'm following evil
guess i'm following evil, i should follow cathedral
blessings i need, but live like i don't need you

so in conclusion
we all seem to stumble, planning our own demise
forgetting the big picture and making it wallet size
so to what's important in my life, i apologize
i promise to stay faithful, focussed and sanctified
we all get distracted
the question is, would you bounce back or bounce backwards
would you not know how to act or take action it's just a part of life
and if your vision's impaired, you probably lose it all tonight

i remember, uh
all my uncles, sir smokers
on alondra, in front of our building
they was my heroes

uh, and that's scary to me
dope beat, dope flow, vary to me
especially when sounwave is on his ps
nigga cue me in, i'm a peruvian drug lord
don't fast forward, i'ma serve you some keys
this is crack cocaine, i'm kurt cobain
and i bang like a c-r-i-p
p-i-r-u, high you, i'm an i-v
this shit is so dope you might wanna be my crack stop
i said an i-v cause when i be
in the studio, i shot a needle in your vein
take it in vain or itch till your eyeballs pop
i'm cold on a cold turkey, i hate chickens
but i do fuck pretty birdies, where your girl at
over the pyrex where my world at

uh, and that's scary to me
every listener is a strawberry to me
you pussies ain't shit but venereal disease
zs on k dot uh uh, better wake up
a nightmare, i'm right there like a siamese
twin, when you motherfuckers gon' learn
curl up like big worm when i drop
who fly i'm a red eye with eyedrops
i big, i 'pac, you chris, i rock
that's pookie on new jack, head-first with a cyclops
i'm the first one to do that, i bet you never knew that
back like a tailbone, who you got to tell on
if it ain't about me, about hoe
or be about face if you ain't on higher, learning
there's soda in the pot and the fire, burning

uh, and it's scary to carry
a smooth-type flow like a drink of merlot
that'll freak y'all out like a girl virgo
when i turbo on any track it's a reynolds wrap
and i rap like a nigga who invented rap, rapping heat
you could fall to defeat if you don't pay your tolls
like the limbs on your feet, i suppose
this is bigger than life
this is probably everybody illuminatis
guess i'm the blood sacrifice
of the party, i undress her like a harley
lights will flash, cars will crash
smoke more junk while the junkies laugh
so my bad if i put you in rehab
you are reimbursed, put it on my, tab

aw dude, you about to fucking od bro

oh, what up hoe oh, what up
i said, oh, what up hoe oh, what up
i said, oh, what up hoe oh, what up
well alright

i'm going through something with life
where pussy and patron make you feel alright
pussy and patron make you feel alright
pussy and patron, that's some great advice

welcome to my diary, stressing got me gray hairs
something to inspire me, rather than society's
woes, let me go, let me shine a lil' bit love
i want diamonds too, ronnie on player's club
i used to have a nine-to-five, fresh out of school, that was '05
that bitch was racist, got me fired, they rushed us then, i had no job
pushing in my mama van, stop for gas on rosecrans
trust me, these niggas rushed me for something my cousin probably did
guilty by association, story of my life nigga
you gon' make me flip, then split yo' shit, judge give me life nigga
pain since my grandma's death, uncle killed at louie's burgers
hold my tears, i tried my best, let it go, trench my pullover
cycles of a starving artist tryna go beyond the margin-margin
maintaining my modest-modest as i dream
so while i go through all-this-all-this, bullshit what you call it
life itself, i know it helps, let me scroll through my blackberry hey what's up daddy

all i need in this lifetime, pussy and patron
give me that, won't you give that once again it's on
bitch i'm swagged up, hoes bopping when i'm off that screw
coming down clean, tell your baby mama what it do
where your friends at i got long dick, what it is
go on poke it out, situate your little positives
how i live big shot, on my grind, all ready
i'ma lay it down like a carpenter when you let me
when you let me, when you let me

give me that funk, that sweet, that nasty
that good shit stuff
i can't get enough
if i offend you, blame it on the liquor babe
give me that funk, that sweet, that nasty
that good shit stuff
i can't get enough
if i offend you

uh, i wrote this song when dave drove home
and caught that flat in the  flats
and it made me think when another car blinked
to change locations where we at
we often get lost in the ever-hard bottle
when attempt to ignore pain, problem and sorrow
just for a minute, then back to the bullshit
your car now due and you bout to get evicted
two drugs surely, patron, pussy, make it feel alright
but once it's empty and the bitch leave, then it's back to life
you can't run from it, gotta run to it nigga
the antidote wouldn't last and you knew it nigga
but still you proceed to dive deep, ask what's her zodiac sign

all i need in this lifetime, pussy and patron
give me that, won't you give that once again it's on
bitch i'm swagged up, hoes bopping when i'm off that screw
coming down clean, tell your baby mama what it do
where your friends at i got long dick, what it is
go on poke it out, situate your little positives
how i live big shot, on my grind, all ready
i'ma lay it down like a carpenter when you let me
when you let me, when you let me

uh, she got me going, i'm all in
fifty stories, i'm falling
where you been is it planet mars
far beyond the stars are you a martian
you're unfamiliar, but still i feel ya
energy is sending me toward the ceiling
i'm high now, are you up there
if you was, i would climb every other stair
i gotta stare, i mean wow
and i'm wowed, no one compares
a one-on-one, you must have won
every pageant in america when you was young
lips, hips, hair drip down her back crazy
body frame crazy, insane, crazy
the only girl that can make time, then make me stop

uh, so now we on, so now we gone
living in the city of the unknown
i show her off, i stunt with her
we do it sweet, they look bitter
look at her get up, i hear 'em say
but why him i hear 'em hate
i laugh at it, rather than jab at it
then continue eternal life as a crack addict
cause i'm addicted, and you the drug
cold turkey no sir
gotta be an odyssey from heaven way above
you definite, not probably, i gotta give it up
lips, hips, hair drip down her back crazy
body frame crazy, insane, crazy
the only girl that can make time, then make me stop

you something different
i'm glad i found you
so pretty
i'll never do anything to hurt you

uh, yeah 
uh
we hurt people that love us, love people that hurt us
hurt people that love us, love people
i'm inspired, so get inspired

and so he said, why you gotta be so kind-hearted
why you couldn't be a con-artist why you couldn't
why you couldn't be mischievous or just a lil' devious
the moment that we first started
why you never ask for nothing, just a lil' time
why you let me use yours cause i don't got mines
why you always lift me up when i'm completely giving up
or when niggas holler what's up, you give a dry response
why you giving me your last, knowing you ain't got it
why you always buy me something when you going shopping
why you tell me that you love me why you always thinking of me
want my company rather than going club hopping
why you treating my momma like she your momma too
why you making promises that you'll forever do
whatever just to make me happy, wanting us to have a family
these are exactly the reasons why i cheat on you, sometimes

we hurt people that love us, love people that hurt us
hurt people that love us, love people that hurt us
hurt people that love us, love people that hurt us
hurt people that love us, love people that hurt us
sometimes i, sometimes i feel we share
 nothing in common, it ain't fair
 but where do we seem to fall
 where do we seem to fall
 tender love and care, once upon a time
 once upon a time, we was there

and so she said, why you gotta be so mean to me
why you don't know what you mean to me
why you always playing games why i feel like you ashamed
out in public, curse me out and make a scenery
why you got other bitches rolling their eyes at me
why text messages popping up saying hi daddy
why you treat me like i'm nothing why you always at a function
i be wanting to go out but you don't never ask me
why you slip and say her name when we having sex
why you always assuming that i still love my ex
every time we get into it, i'm the one that's feeling stupid
you don't need me, you gon' leave me, that's your favorite threat
why you never know how it feel to be lonely
why i feel i'm the last option after your homies
why you always gotta know that i will never let you go
even though you get violent and put your hands on me sometimes

uh, every time i'm in my city i be hacking like my shit don't stink
used to clean my rollie chain with alcohol in the sink
riding round with niggas that i grew up with since mcnair
bumping me against the world, hello world, kendrick here
and i'm too two much for these niggas, i'm three much for these hoes
i'm too two much for these niggas, i'm three much for these hoes
i'm too two much for these niggas, i'm three much for these hoes
wayne told me that, and that's just how it goes
michael jordan
bounce-bounce hoe, bounce-bounce

this shit make a nigga wanna get some bread or bust a head
or fuck my enemy's bitch, acting bad and getting rich
pull up on them twenty-sixes, i'm a vanity slave
i'm a sinner, jesus christ, please forgive me for my ways
i don't know why your bitch wanna fuck me
and i don't know why you fuck niggas can't see
i'm a comp-town representer, concrete backflipper
aka that nigga, don't worry

this is hiiipower, since the eddie bower i've been popular
i'm popping now, every other hour, paparazzi come
you jocking her, let her be a hoe, why you stopping her
we stopping the traffic, what you know bout them hockey pucks
skating on 'em, why you hating on 'em you should learn from 'em
seen too many of y'all getting money, know my turn coming
i don't know why your bitch wanna fuck me
and i don't know why hey, wait a minute motherfucker

every time i'm in my city i be feeling like my shit don't stink
used to clean my rollie chain with alcohol in the sink
riding round with niggas that i grew up with since mcnair
bumping me against the world, hello world, kendrick here
and i'm too two much for these niggas, i'm three much for these hoes
i'm too two much for these niggas, i'm three much for these hoes
i'm too two much for these niggas, i'm three much for these hoes
wayne told me that, and that's just how it goes
michael jordan bitch, michael jordan bitch
michael jordan bitch, michael jordan bitch
that means i'm too two much for these niggas, i'm three much for these hoes
wayne told me that, and that's just how it goes

man, the game chose me, what am i to do
only thing i did wrong was make it possible
i diddy bop and make them titties pop
out there on my bumper like a city cop
walking out of fred segal, put my girl on it
ass so fat, probably sit the world on it
ay, pussy crazy, pussy crazy

please no soda pop, i make my solo pop
life's a bitch, her pussy crazy
but i make that pussy pay me

lord, forgive me kill him where he stand
then stand over him, shake his hand, then jump back in that minivan
double back to his block and blam, i ain't backing down for nothing
i'm back 'em down like shaq' with this black 223 in my hand
better pray that this chopper jam like a radio single man
police radio signal saying that a one-eighty-seven land
on your corner, coroners comfort your mama, mama he's dead, the next morning
high toasted up with my homies, we drink and smoke marijuana
want us to change our ways uh huh, you see this game we play come from
uncles that raised me in compton, ask me what i have accomplished
i don't know, i don't have conscience, i just load up and start dumping
on enemies, i'm head-hunting, no sympathy, ain't no love when
you in these streets, just get something, protect your neck cause they coming
for set respects, split your onion, then chop your deck, your head tumbling like gymnastics
cause ignorance is bliss

this the hardest shit you heard from la this far
and i'm this far from a discharge, but never will i diss y'all
we all tryna ball, and when i got the rock i'll dish off
until the day i pistol whip you posers till y'all pissed off
then peel off in a hoopty, come back and make these niggas wanna shoot me
and they bitches wanna salute me or seduce me
indubitably i'm too street, indubitably i'ma do me better than your bitch would
but you niggas too weak, but just give me two weeks and i'm good
i'll make an album that will put a smile on malcolm
make martin luther tell god i'm the future for heaven's talent
no tarot card reading, i'm foreseeing you niggas vanish
not only from the rap game, i'm including the planet
cats so watered down, clowns can sink titanic
tie titanium around they neck and watch 'em panic
give me respect damn it, or get damaged
die young, corpse identified by your parents, apparently you a parrot
mocking me and my blueprint, but i won't share it
just make you cop it, then call you a sheriff, stop it
i'm hearing the comments, the critics are calling me conscious
but truthfully, every shooter be calling me compton
so truthfully, only calling me kweli and common
proves that ignorance is bliss

and this still the hardest shit you've heard from la this far
and i'm this far from a discharge, but never will i diss y'all
it's my world, i grab the universe then play kickball
and they wonder why these california earthquakes hitting so hard
i'm socal, you so-called, rappers need to go call
ghostbusters to shoot busters, i'm casper when i go off
i show up to show out and show off, you a hundred percent behind me
and if you hard then wreck your car, then walk up to my crime scene
i remember being seventeen wishing someone would sign me
now the only way these labels get me back is when they rewind me
backing down bargains, backing down bitches
we gon' flip her when she off that blue dolphin, you gon' tip her
cause ignorance is bliss
and willie b, i'm a fool on your beats
i bleed out the speaker as the speaker that spoke when they didn't speak

this is me thinking at 4:43 am, june 6

sometimes i wanna say fuck rapping, i need money now
like should i start trapping if what i write down
don't connect this very moment, then i'm on it, no question
in the streets my niggas is well connected, let's see
do i cop a pound of kush, promethazine or push some e
oxycontin have laying on soft cotton when i sleep
this is deep as the abyss, i'm not just rhyming on the beat
i be in spots chopping the rocks like flintstone feet
this is me frustrated, battling my own evils
finna saddle up that work, across ohio in a geo
or should i sell my music zip to buy your zip
and hope one day it flourish to a kilo, track record of a hustler
rather records on the needle, making music
clocking fast bank like a shot from patrick ewing
my nigga, what you doing on these corners with me
i thought you had a show well i guess my nigga, i didn't
i'm tryna get this dough and easy money sounds tempting
especially when your homies pushing v8 engines
twenty-two on twenty-sixes, range rovers rolling up
three-fifty for an ounce of fire, i hope i got enough
this industry calling my bluff, i need a new solution
curve-serving, know i might be in your store boosting
two-elevens with mac-11s like fuck hip hop
don't wanna be pun, don't wanna be big, don't wanna be 'pac
just give me your funds, aka everything that you got
or everything getting shot, for nothing
leave you in shock, coughing up blood and mumbling
watch, the plans of a young man sponsor
moving grams like relocating your mom's momma
then expand to the hoover dam, water
sherm, contraband, they yearn for the butt-naked
fuck a verse, verses get let off in thirty minutes, six seconds
i disperse to the world of unruly, where i put the mic down
and pick up a sack and a toolie, if you knew me
you'll know i always had a passion for riddle when writing
but lately i've been thinking bout taking chances to brighten
my future financially, so please don't be mad at me
i gotta do what i gotta do, no shit
so i tell my nigga front me, let me put it on the strip
then give it back when i think about the consequence, shit

rotc, or right on time conscience

one time
reporting live, compton, california

have you ever felt like, like you never get life
like you never get right sort of like a black sheep
back down, backing out your dreams like some bad sleep
chasing for the win but you never win the track meet
oh, what a cold world for a broke nigga, it's bitter
and life's a bitch, don't hit women so i bit her
i struck enough pain, let her know i wasn't playing
i was so sincere like nas' first name
in belly, they'd tell me, it's very difficult to see twenty-five
and if i survive i probably wouldn't sell it
my opportunities are low because my brown complexion floats
in the ghetto, rather in some heals like giuseppe's
they want me unemployed, until i hit the streets
for filling voids of broke d-boys selling weed
fucking up my prestige, till i live with the blues
bb king or the neighbors of snoop

that's why i'm in the club like fuck it though
they say it's only one life, life, life
and if you say i can't live comfortable
i'ma tell you that's a lie, lie, lie
so while i hold this bottle of ciroc with a hand full of ass
celebrate the very day that i get past
through the barbed wire
we are, we are fighters
 we are, we are true
 through the, through barbed wires
 we will, will break through
so while i hold this bottle of ciroc with a hand full of ass
celebrate the very day that i get past
through the barbed wire

have you ever felt like, like you never get life
like you never did right sort of like a black sheep
tryna get away from the world stereotype
barbed wire got a barricade on your destiny
she desperately in need of some inspiration, see what the people saying
she gon' have a baby, then flee from her education
at the age of sixteen, credit card scam schemes
see a scar on her eye, boyfriend brutality
she will never get by, no how, no way
welfare recipient, property of the state
housing, section 8, corner store, prostitute
the owner bout to prosecute, the niggas tell her that she cute
hoodrat trashy, six baby daddies
and this baby daddy is new to the family
chilling in pajamies, waiting on the first
fast-forward, spilling drinks on her fur

that's why she in the club like fuck it though
they say it's only one life, life, life
and if you say she can't live comfortable
she gon' tell you that's a lie, lie, lie
so while she up in vip pouring merlot in her glass
celebrate the very day that she get past
through the barbed wire
we are, we are fighters
 we are, we are true
 through the, through barbed wires
 we will, will break through
so while she up in vip pouring merlot in her glass
celebrate the very day that she get past
through the barbed wire

have you ever felt like you finally got life
you finally got right no longer a black sheep
living off your dreams like christina uh-milian in the front seat
of a convertible, eloping to get married
what a feeling of overcoming the odds
it's like you just hit the lottery, my god
there must be a god, cause golly
you done made it through the fight while squabbling, ali
now your lifestyle's looking up and you escaped the crooked cops
and you ain't have to kill a nigga just to make a couple bucks
and she ain't have to go and fuck on everybody for a dollar
making good decisions, got an independent business mind
and both of y'all are steady grinding, doing it the legal way
just tryna make a decent pay on every second of the day
but they won't give you the credit, disses out they mouth
you must have joined the illuminati just to ball out

in the club like fuck it though
they say it's only one life, life, life
and if you say they can't live comfortable
they gon' tell you that's a lie, lie, lie
so even if you overcame doubt and your living ain't bad
know it's some barbed wire that's always in your path
through the barbed wire

just laugh, then everybody say

the hardest thing for me to do
is to get you, to know me, within sixteen bars
that's the hardest thing

who is k dot a young nigga from compton
on the curb writing raps next to a gun shot
on the corners where the gangsters and the killers dwell
the fraudulent tender scars that get unveiled
everyone i knew was either crip or piru
cousins in elementary, relatives in high school
with that being said, each one of their rivals
was aiming something at my head, i needed survival
got jumped, got jacked, shot at, shot back
and i don't even push a line, i'm just tryna push these rhymes
in the midst of staying neutral and discrete
my momma said you're judged by the company you keep
but what you can consider, that if it goes down
they'll kill you if you kill me, it gets deep nigga
so if you ask what i'm doing
i'm tryna duck the influence of my city that's blue-and, real talk, and

i was walking from centennial
when an unidentified vehicle rolled up, and i was like hold up
where you from i don't bang
where you stay westside, that's a piru gang to be exact
well aware they had blue across they hat
dropped backpack and ran inside of the cul-de-sac
shots rang out, hoping to god i wasn't wet
crossed to cross rosecrans and ran inside of the yet
chirped the homies on the hot ninety-five, they said they already knew
what happened, and meet 'em outside the garage
never seen that many guns in my life
i was paranoid like a fiend in the night, but needed revenge
grabbed the nine-ball, opened up the door, then got in
somebody said fall back, we gon' make these niggas suffer
you my brother like a frat, and that's just to remind you
thought about that so long i had failed my finals, fuck, but

i don't do black music, i don't do white music
i do everyday life music
give 'em cuts like a nigga pierced a knife through it
you say you through, but i've been through it, now that's cold
and this is for my county building children
in hub city on hubcaps, no power-steering
i use perseverance in this mad city
where the niggas drink remy and hold semis for cutthroats
bernie mac died, it's no joke
don't ask why if you don't know about these killers and thieves
seven grams of weed, you smoke that, but i'm high off life
i could fall out the sky like twice
and land in the land of the aks
and the minivans where the fan never on
cause it's hotter than a lunatic's underarms in a straitjacket
in other words, we get it cracking, but i keep it cool, y'know

so there you have it
but i'ma leave you with this
an og once told me
a real gangster is either dead or in jail
or behind the scenes getting real money
i'm gone

hoc, hoc
all the real smokers give me hoc
all the real smokers give me hoc
hoc, hoc
all the real smokers give me hoc
hoc

everybody know i spit that hunk of shit
shit that make you duck for cover shit
shit that make you hop out your seat and slap your mother shit
especially when drop drop the beat
i drop jewels like my nuts dropped out of my briefs
jump in the booth, then shatter every rapper's dream
they jump in a sauna because i killed their self-esteem
that's a jab, you should bob and weave
like pam when martin pulled jokes out his sleeve
i go in studio sessions and feel like a nerd
cause i'm the only nigga there not smoking no herb
you telling me the kush make you think on level four
i'm on five, you saying i can level more
in high school, my teachers thought i was smoking stress
didn't know my eyes low cause of genetic defects
i stimulate my mind every time i think about the end of time
creation of man and columbine

look, nowadays everybody think they big chiefers
just cause they heard that new tape from wiz khalifa
knowing damn well they can't hit the sour
they new booties, they probably need baby powder
my skill shower over your city for forty days
forty nights, off the chain like freedom of slaves
before you get it twisted like forty gays
my flow worth the earth, that's not to be appraised
those the type of lines that i'm talking bout
you know, the type of rhymes you don't talk about
copy my session on a disc when the session ends
so my mama can have it and play it for her friends
brag on me like my son's bout to win
somehow, someday, and i don't care when
i might hit the gin once a month
i'll let you inhale in hell, like an atheist

uhh, i'll take you back to the ninth grade
when dough boy had me high for four days
that's my nigga, he a street nigga
probably in your hood fucking up your street nigga
but anyway, i think it was some purple
told me don't hit it hard because it'll hurt you
i didn't listen, i was floating like the rose parade
swear to god a nigga seen some flying fishes
that was the vegas trip hooters sponsored
the same time i start writing like a fucking monster
i'm frankenstein every time this motherfucker ponders
just underline every letter
capital k-d-o-t, letting it flat out
like a tire with slow leaks, and what you bout
nothing huh am i square cause i don't puff a square
are my raps too blunt to hit the blunt yeah

hoc, hoc
all the real smokers give me hoc
all the real smokers give me hoc bitch i'm blowed
hoc, hoc bitch i'm blowed
all the real smokers give me hoc
all the real smokers give me hoc

uh-uh-uh, uh, uh-uh-uh, uh
ali, you thirsty on twitter 
you boo-boo, you t
you turned down, you thirsty
you boo-boo

uh, i'm tryna learn something new
i'm tryna find myself, i'm searching deep for kendrick lamar
i read about napoleon hill and try to know god
they say he the key to my blessings
and if i speak the good into existence, that instant my dreams will unlock
money flow like water, i'll just wait at the dock
and by the way i'ma start, finding more light to shed
like a small garage in your backyard
i'm back chilling with a friend of mine, she mighty fine
but i notice that her heart resides next to bitterness
always hollering who she don't like, and who she kick it with
who she wanna fight, who wearing a weave
who dooney   bourke bag is fake, who holding the keys
to the car she drove last year, or who fucking on who
and who need a pap smear, getting on my nerves
but before your negative energy curve, bitch, i'ma cut you off

uh, i'm tryna learn something new
i'm tryna surround myself with people that inspire me
or at least inquire similar desires
to do what it t-a-k-e just to reach the t-o-p
i'm talking ideas, motivation
it's more than making enemies my nigga
oh, that's not your memo then tell me why you constant stressing
on how much you well connected like centipedes my nigga
i function with you and you flaunt your pistol
every second tell me how you pressed him at the monte crystal
where so-and-so from, and what neighborhoods beefing
who baby momma's a rat, and who got killed last weekend
that shit is mad depressing, bringing me down
speak on something with some substance that can get us both paid
rather than telling me how these niggas jocking your style
or his rims ain't bigger, pussy nigga, i'ma cut you off

uh, i'm tryna learn something new
i'm tryna better my chances of becoming a star
i'm tryna feel the vibe of mona lisa, studying art
now paint that picture, life behind bars
remember the very day i got caught
i murdered a rapper, and you filed the police report
see what i was taught, family is all i need
but indeed, them too can run me right up a tree
constantly talking shit bout the next relative
wanting me to take sides, but i'd never give in
ever since grandma died everyone parted ways
argue on holidays, left my uncle in prison
for fifteen years no one paid, him attention but moms
yeah my momma as loyal as any sister would come
come to my house just to yap about your own people, dang
and if your blood wasn't running through my veins
i would probably cut y'all off, too, yep

so tell 'em shut the fuck up
tell 'em shut the fuck up
yeah bitch you boo-boo, you t
you turned down, you thirsty
tell 'em shut the fuck up
tell 'em shut the fuck up
yeah nigga you boo-boo, you t
you turned down, you thirsty
you thirsty, you boo-boo

you thirsty, you t

you boo-boo, you t
you turned down, you weak
you weak, yo' bitch weak
yeah 
you boo-boo, you t 
keep all that

what is hiiipower
hiiipower is the way we think, the way we live
see it's known today that the human race is nothing
no moral, no standards
what we're about to do is raise the level of expectations
no you don't have to have a lot of money
you don't have to be rich
but you will be rich in mind and spirit
some say it's as big as a crew, some say it's as big as a gang
hiiipower, we stand for it as if it's as big as a religion

niggas hating, bitches hating, babies dying
bullets flying, helicopters, police sirens, preachers lying
genosism, criticism, unemployment, racism
burning buildings, aids victims, cancer killing, no cure
oil spilling, turmoil, poverty-stricken
police brutality kicking ass of us africans, hostages in afghanistan
not to mention another prison, child molesting
cow intestines, botox injection, earthquakes that's government testing
secret society weapon, opium plant manifested
that turn to crack, then invest it amongst us blacks, just a method
to hold us back, great depression, amongst iraq no direction
no google map, just a tec for the soowoo
swerving isuzu, then blah-blah-blah, adolescents go cuckoo
mothers are boo-boo crying, the governor keep us starving
these commercials keep us buying these cigarettes
supermarkets fill up our liver with triumph, distinctive living with science
no place to live in, no zion, see that's forbidden, we frying

my nigga, what it look like
that's exactly what hell look like, uh

malcolm laughing, martin laughing, biggie spitting
'pac is rapping, gregory capping, people singing, bells is ringing
children playing, angels praying, fourteen carat golden streets
cali greens, red wine, potato yams, turkey legs
calling every human being

what's up love it's been a while

remember dinner dates i was late mr chiles
truant like a student, you the principal
schooled me on timing, we was both shining
like the sun bouncing off the brightest blood diamond
i was your highness, you was my queen
you got over him when i got in between
watching martin on tv as it was t-d-s
for us to eat tv dinners every time we was famished
but it was such a pleasure to watch you try to hold it together
every time i put the head in you would panic
and come right down like an avalanche
make your legs slant, whisper till you juicing up your pants
baby how that sound kosher, no sir
wake it back up, folgers posters
by my waistline, shot for your heart and
you called it a hate crime, say you want me back
and your girl wanna date dom, that's high school shit
4-0-1 k, we could be friends with benefits, you dig that

fire burning inside my eyes, this the music that saved my life

to give 'em my full attention, ten-hut, man i gotta get my wind up

knock of the doors of opportunity, i'm too involved
i'm no activist, i'm no einstein, before calculus i was kicking in math
dropping that science like an alchemist, and i be kicking that ass
lyrically i'm ufc
if a ufo had came for me i'ma come back with the head of alien
don't alienate my dreams, get it right, get a life
i got two, that's a metaphor for the big shit i do
boy, tmi, tsa, man i'm fly

yeah i know life's a bitch, get the best of her

put them threes up, they notice that we up
hiiipower, and the power, and the people, and if they don't believe us
they'll die
wizard

i wrote this record while thirty thousand feet in the air
stewardess complimenting me on my nappy hair
if i can fuck her in front of all these passengers
they'll probably think i'm a terrorist
eat my asparagus, then i'm asking her
thoughts of a young nigga, fast money and freedom
a crash dummy for diamonds, i know you dying to meet 'em
i'll probably die in a minute
just bury me with twenty bitches, twenty million and a comp-town fitted

back in this bitch in the back of that bitch
with my back against the wall, and your bitch on the edge of my dick
jump off, i call a bitch a bitch
a hoe a hoe, a woman a woman, i never did nothing
but break the ground on top of the asphalt
tire mark gave you evidence that i'm easily peddling
with the speed of a lightning bolt
as a kid i killed two adults, i'm too advanced
i lived my twenties at two years old, the wiser man
truth be told i'm like '87
wicked as eighty reverends in a pool of fire with devils holding hands
from a distance, don't know which one is a christian, damn
who can i trust in 2012 there's no one, not even myself
a gemini screaming for help, somebody

twenty-four seven nigga, working his ass for it, she popping that ass for it
the king of diamonds with diamonds i never do ask for
they checking my passport, i'm too accustomed with customs
she call in the task force, i killed it, somebody cuff him
they want me fast-forward the game, and why you complain
when you niggas is past poor you'll never hop in my lane
when you pushing a rav4, you wrecking my jaguar
you play like a bad sport, her feet on the dashboard

i wrote this record while thirty-thousand feet in the air
stewardess complimenting me on my nappy hair
if i can fuck her in front of all these passengers
they'll probably think i'm osama
the plane emergency landed, it was an honor, hol' up

uh-uh, fuck that

man i swear, my nigga tripping off that shit again, pick him up, then i set him in
cold water, then i order someone to bring him vicodin
hope to take the pain away from the feeling that he feel today
you know when you're part of section 8, and you feel like no one can relate
cause you are, you are, a loner, loner
marijuana, endorphins make you stronger, stronger
i'm in the house party tripping off, my generation sipping cough
syrup like it's water, never no pancakes in the kitchen
man, no wonder our lives is caught up in the daily superstition
that the world is bout to end, who gives a fuck we never do listen
unless it comes with an 808, a melody and some hoes
playstation and some drank, technology bumping 'soul
looking around and all i see is a big crowd that's product of me
and they probably relatives, relevant for a rebel's dream
yep, her president is black, she black too
purple label on her back, but that dap
is like when she take it straight to the head, then she look at me
she got adhd

like whoa-oh, whoa
whoa-oh, whoa i don't got a limit, just give me some more with it
whoa-oh, whoa i don't got a limit, just give me some more with it
whoa-oh, whoa they always told me adhd did it
whoa-oh

and then she started
and then she started feeling herself like no one else in this apartment
beg your pardon how i rap baby, how old are you
she say twenty-two, i say twenty-three, ok then we all crack babies
damn, why you say that she said where my drink at
i'ma tell you later, just tell your neighbors, have the police relax
i stood up, shut the blinds, closed the screen, jumbotron
made to the back where she reside, then she said read between the lines
yep, hope that i get close enough when the lights turn down
and the fact that she might just open up when the new flow start to drown
her body and i, know the both of us really deep in the move now
it's nothing we can do now, somebody walked in with a pound
of that bay area kush, she looked at me, then looked
at it, then she grabbed it, then she said get it, understood
you know why we crack babies, because we born in the eighties
that adhd crazy

like whoa-oh, whoa
whoa-oh, whoa i don't got a limit, just give me some more with it
whoa-oh, whoa i don't got a limit, just give me some more with it
whoa-oh, whoa they always told me adhd did it
whoa-oh

you can have all my shine, i'll give you the light
double cup, deuce, four, six, just mix it in sprite
ecstasy, shrooms, blow, 'dro, hoes, whatever you like
you can have all my shine, i'll give you the light

i know she bout to ask me how she look
i tell her beautiful, and how long it took
for you to put it on it was early in the morn'
she resembled a model out of a mac book
concentrating on the way the eyeliner thickens
i stand behind her and try to figure her vision
of prettiness, the wittiness of colors on her skin tone
her complexion in a direction i've outgrown
damn girl, why so much
you bout to blow your cover when you cover up
don't you know your imperfections is a wonderful blessing
from heaven is where you got it from
i love your smile, you can do it without style
from your lips, all the way to your eyebrows
it's the beauty in her, but when the makeup occur
i don't see it, all i see is a blur

i know she bout to ask me how she look
i tell her beautiful, and how long it took
for you to put it on it was early in the morn'
she resembled a model out of a mac book
concentrating on the way my eyeliner thickens
he stand behind me and try to figure her vision
of prettiness, the wittiness of colors on my skin tone
 my complexion in a direction i've outgrown
i feel like it's not enough
 i can never put on too much makeup
 yeah i know your imperfections i be constantly stressing
 from him is where i get it from
 they tell me i need to smile at least once in a while
 i hate my lips, my nose, my eyebrows
it's the beauty in me, but what he don't see
 is that i had a black eye 
to be continued, eleven

ladies and gentlemen
and you ain't gotta get drunk to have fun
you ain't gotta get drunk to have fun
and you ain't gotta get drunk to have fun
you ain't gotta get drunk to have fun

i know this girl, she a real good girl, and she be low-key
looking like a star with a real nice car, a mercedes key
and she got a nigga, and she love this nigga, well at least i think
every time we bark she pay us no mind, in the middle of the street
she be like

until one day he wasn't acting right, in the middle of the night
she checked his phone, erica, right when he plead the fifth
man, it was on, matter of fact she gone, matter of fact tyrone
was on speed dial, so when she got home, it was going down
she go

i know this girl, she a real hood girl, and she with the shit
keep her hair tied up, big bamboos, mike jordan kicks
with that big butt, but when i try holla, she gon' resist
in her man she trust, so when i walk by her, she be screaming this
she be like

until one day he wasn't acting right, in the middle of the night
she checked his pockets, found condoms by magnum, and the moment
they was acknowledged, she popped his eye, then ran outside
then started driving on the passenger side, homeboy was smiling
she go

and so these girls, these vulnerable girls, took they men up
put 'em in they world, they vulnerable world, and just like that it was
only getting-got they feelings hurt, tell me how that sound
they got fed up with the biggest question mark, they curious now
cause when women get sick of men, they think of a big helping hand
to lend each other, uncover emotions when lights dim
so when she telling her to come over, it will be alright
the minute she hit the block and turn left, she be turning dyke
they go

tammy's song

riding with them boys and girls and we're high
all we want to do is have a good time
young, wild and reckless is how we live life
pray that we make it to twenty-one, one, one, one
whoa-ohhh, whoa-ohhh
we make it to twenty-one, one, one, one
whoa-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh

dragging the record industry by my fangs
ak clips, money clips and gold chains

bullet to your temple, you're homicidal, remind me, that

like, really out here he copping some blow, hoping that he can stretch
newborn massacre, hopping out the passenger
with calendars, cause your day coming
run him down and then he gun him down, i'm hoping that you fast enough
even the legs of michael johnson don't mean nothing, because

just ride with me, just die with me, that gun store right there
when you fight don't fight fair, cause you'll never win
right, i had the chopper and i tore they ass up

smoke good, eat good, live good

i used to want to see the penitentiary, way after elementary
thought it was cool to look the judge in the face when he sentenced me
since my uncles was institutionalised
my intuition has said i was suited for family ties
my mama is stressing, my daddy tired
i need me a weapon, these niggas ride
every minute, hour and second, ministers tried
to save me, how i'm gon' listen when i don't even hear god
heaven or hell, base it all on my instincts
my hands dirty, you worried bout mud in your sink
you like to mistake a street nigga for real nigga
that same nigga that kill with ya squeal with ya
i deal with ya like my son, stare at the sun
and you'll be looking in my eyes homie
stand for something or fall for anything
and you working with two left feet at the skating rink
but anyway, this for my niggas
uncles, twenty-three hours sending me pictures
i want you to know that i'm so determined to blow
that you hear the music i wrote, hope it get you off death row
you came home to a pocket full of stones
a metropc' phone, then you went back in
so when i touch the pen, the pen is in my view
i'ma get it right just so you

smoke good, eat good, live good

you like to mistake a street nigga for real nigga
that same nigga that kill with ya squeal with ya
i'd like to start it out from the bottom and build with ya
be on my last dollar and split the bill with ya
i'm twenty-three with morals and plans of living cordial
not rich but wealthy, there's nothing you can tell me
my killings are not remorseful, the city got my back
before that, i give them my torso
you think about it, and don't call me lyrical
cause really i'm just a nigga that's evil and spiritual
i know some rappers using big words to make they similes curve
my simplest shit be more pivotal
i penetrate the hearts of good kids and criminals
worry some individuals that live life critical
so won't you bare witness while i bare feet
so you can walk in my shoes and get to know me
but anyway, this for my pops
on his lunch break eating in that parking lot
on wanna be heard probably thought he worked my nerves
but really he was stressing me, getting what i deserved
somebody said my name on the radio, he ain't know
i was ready for the world that minute
so the next time he roll up and drop grams in it, he'll probably be
out of work, laid back, while he

smoke good, eat good, live good

when i was sleeping on couches

nigga i was motherfucking out yeah
with the flashing lights, had me stuck like reindeer

i was somewhere stuck with a flame yeah

uh, drop my chair, hold my joy, show my pride
music saved my fucking life

we apologize if you ever knew
too many niggas, and not enough hoes
and most of you niggas acting like hoes

babies from eighties don't know no' better
don't nothing go better with ignorance
but the belligerent kids that we living with
some of them masculine, some of them feminine
'member the universe used to innocent
now they just look at us crazy like immigrants
every day that i wake up, i'ma sin again
i'm not a citizen, i'm just a nigga from section 80

uh, and lord knows she's beautiful
lord knows the usuals leaving her body sore
she takes the little change she make to fix her nail cuticles
lipstick is suitable to make you fiend for more
she play mr shakur, that's her favorite rapper
bumping brenda's got a baby while a pervert yelling at her
and she capture features of a woman, but only seventeen
the seven cars start honking, she start running
like flo-jo, don't care if they joe blow
if they got money to blow, a blow job is a sure go
and sure enough don't see a dime of dirty dollars
just give all to her daddy, but she don't know her father, that's ironic
see a block away from lueders park, i seen the el camino parked
and in her heart she hate it there, but in her mind she made it where
nothing really matters, so she hit the back seat
rosa parks never a factor when she making ends meet

and lord knows she's beautiful
lord knows the usuals leaving her body sore
her anatomy is god's temple
and it's quite simple, her castle is bout to be destroyed
she's always paranoid, watching the law inside the streets
undercovers and dummies that look like decoys
remember sergeant let her slide
said if he seen what's between her thighs he'd compromise, to no surprise
she took the ultimatum round the alleyway and gave him
a warm welcome that filled him right below the navel
though he was wired up like a pair of jumping cables
his eyes was closed shut, prior charges, he had waived 'em
it was a block away from lueders park, i seen a squad car parked
and in her heart she hate it there, but in her mind she made it where
nothing really matters, so she hit the back seat
cause rosa parks never a factor when she topping off police

and lord knows she's beautiful
lord knows the usuals leaving her body sore
as she bust down like a twelve bunk on tour
she suddenly realized she'll never escape the allure
of the black man, white man, needing satisfaction
at first it became a practice, but now she's numb to it
sometimes she wonder if she can do it like nuns do it
but she never heard of catholic religion or sinners' redemption
that sounds foolish, and you can blame it on her mother
for letting her boyfriend slide candy under her cover
ten months before she was ten, he moved in and that's when he touched her
this motherfucker is the fucking reason why keisha rushing
through that block away from lueders park, i seen the el camino parked
and in her heart she hate it there, but in her mind she made it where
nothing really matters, so she hit the back seat
then caught a knife inside the bladder, left her dead, raped in the street
keisha's song

mm, my little sister eleven, i looked her right in the face
the day that i wrote this song, sat her down and pressed play

alright here we go, third take
 real quick ali, mm

and this is riga-mortis
and it's gorgeous when you die
ali recorded and i'm morpheus
the matrix of my mind
i'm out the orbit
you an orphan and a hairdresser combined
i'm on the toilet when i rhyme
if you the shit then i decline
i climax where you begin
and then i end on cloud nine
and that's important when you morph
into an angel in the sky
and don't be forging all my signatures
my listeners reply
and tell me that you biting style
you got a hell of an appetite
and i'ma be here for a while
just buckle up before the ride
or knuckle up if you could fight
we always making them duck or die
a suit and a tie is suitable
and usual, it's suicide
csi just might investigate
this fucking parasite

i rapped him and made him casper
i captured the likes of nasa
my pedigree to fly past ya
i'll pass the weed to the pastor
we all are sinners
won't you send us to bible study faster
your hypocrite is reaction of blasphemy
i assassin my casualty
and it's casually done
and tell 'em my salary come
in lumps of a hundreds
don't talk to me bout no money
the sun is under my feet
and i come in peace to compete
i don't run if you'd rather leap
my statistics go up in weeks
and i go visit the nearest street
and i get busy on many emcees
really ballistic, anybody can see
any assistance, everybody done see
some persistence, recognize i be
really too vicious, the permanent beast
and the demolition breaking up the streets
better partition, better dot you t
and i gon' mention, how the fog you see
putting my dick in the rap industry
everybody bitching, getting mad at me
recognize kendrick in the battery
and i'm charged up, and the catastrophe
is star-struck, and the audacity
of y'all fucks, never could hassle me
and y'all luck, just ran out, you'll see

check, check, check, check
it go

ride to it, ride to it, cause you never know
when a bullet might hit and you die to it, die to it
die to it, die to it, live your life, live it right
be different, do different things, don't do it like
he did, cause he ain't what you is, but we can win
wait, let's get straight to the point

to the meaning of life, what's my purpose
maybe this earth is, ain't a good place to be
how far is heaven let's see
is it in the clouds like they said it would be
i wonder when i die will he give me receipts
i wonder will the eyes of the lord look at me
look at me, look at me, i'm a loser, i'm a winner
i'm good, i'm bad, i'm a christian, i'm a sinner
i'm humble, i'm loud, i'm righteous, i'm a killer
what i'm doing, i'm saying that i'm human, now people just

it go one, two, three
two in the front, one in the back seat, seat
seat, seat, looking for a victim of an ak-47
hundred round each, each, each
but why must we retaliate is it human nature
i don't know, i look for the answers later
make a right, there they go, sometimes gotta

as i open this book and then burn up some of this reefer
my plan is to figure out the world and escape all my demons
i'm dying inside, i wonder if zion inside the heavens
a condom, a rollie, pain, a fat blunt and a mac-11
that's all i see in my life and they tell me to make it right
but i'm right on the edge on everest and i might jump tonight
have you ever had known a saint that was taking sinner's advice
well it's probably you, am i right if i'm wrong, you a fucking lie
when i lie on back and look at the ceiling, it's so appealing to pray
i wonder if i'm just a villain dealing my morals away
some people look at my face, then tell me don't worry bout it
i give 'em back they deposit, no money, just total silence
i'm running, they say i'm wildin'  a youngun with lack of guidance
there's hundreds of us with problems, more money, more drugs and violence
look at the soul of an out-of-control artist that's dealing with life the hardest
that's on my life, but regardless i'ma

smoking out, pouring up, keep that lean up in my cup
 all my car got leather and wood, in my hood we call it buck
 everybody wanna ball, holla at broads at the mall
 if he up, watch him fall, i can't fuck with y'all
pussy ass hoe niggas i can't fuck with y'all
bitches all up in my business i can't fuck with y'all
industry of counterfeits i can't fuck with y'all

taking off when you landing
bitch niggas gonna throw tantrums
and i'm dancing on them stars
the galaxy ain't got room for y'all
ain't nothing gonna happen soon for y'all
while i'm here, and every day i hear
your bullshit, self-pity
reason why you never dealt with me
reason why your girl dealt with me
hands up in the building, we get busy, and say
r-i-p aaliyah, r-i-p, yep

that's exactly what this sound like
a to the a to the l-i-y

i wrote this because i was ordered to
people say i speak for generation y
why lie i do
section 80, your son will play me if radio won't
daughters that just turned one to twenty-one listen to kendrick
for instance

true story
hmm, can you repeat that for me 'soul

see a lot of y'all don't understand kendrick lamar
because you wonder how i could talk about money, hoes, clothes, god and history
all in the same sentence
you know what all them things have in common
only half of the truth if you tell it
see i spent twenty-three years on this earth searching for answers
till one day i realised i had to come up with my own
i'm not on the outside looking in, i'm not on inside looking out
i'm in the dead fucking centre looking around
you ever seen a newborn baby kill a grown man
that's an analogy for the way the world make me react
my innocence been dead
so the next time i talk about money, hoes, clothes, god and history
all in the same sentence
just know i meant it, and you felt it
cause you too are searching for answers
i'm not the next pop star, i'm not the next socially aware rapper
i am a human motherfucking being over dope ass instrumentation
kendrick lamar
now fuck 'em up terrace
'soul

everybody put three fingers in the air
the sky is falling, the wind is calling
stand for something or die in the morning
section 80, hiiipower

visions of martin luther staring at me
malcolm x put a hex on my future, someone catch me
i'm falling victim to a revolutionary song
the serengeti's clone
back to put you backstabbers back on your spinal bone
you slipped your disc when i slid you my disc
you wanted to diss, but jumped on my dick
grown men never should bite their tongue
unless you eating pussy that smell like it's a stale plum
i got my finger on the motherfucking pistol
aiming it at a pig, charlotte's web is gonna miss you
my issue isn't televised, and you ain't gotta tell the wise
how to stay on beat, because our life's an instrumental
this is physical and mental, i won't sugar-coat it
you'd die from diabetes if these other niggas wrote it
and everything on tv just a figment of imagination
i don't want no plastic nation, dread that like a haitian
while you motherfuckers waiting, i be off the slave ship
building pyramids, writing my own hieroglyphs

visions of martin luther staring at me
if i see it how he seen it, that would make my parents happy
sorry mama, i can't turn the other cheek
they wanna knock me off the edge like a fucking widow's peak, uhh
and she always told me pray for the weak, uhh
them demons got me, i ain't prayed in some weeks, uhh
dear lord come save me, the devil's working hard
he probably clocking double shifts on all of his jobs
frightening, so fucking frightening
enough to drive a man insane, i need a license
to kill, i'm standing on a field full of land mines
doing the moonwalk, hoping i blow up in time
cause 2012 might not be a fucking legend
trying to be a fucking legend, the man of mankind
who said a black man in the illuminati
last time i checked that was the biggest racist party
so get up off that slave ship
build your own pyramids, write your own hieroglyphs

every day we fight the system
just to make our way, we been down for too long
but that's alright, we was built to be strong
cause it's our life, na-na-nah
every day we fight the system
we fight the system
we fight the system
never liked the system
we been down for too long
but that's alright, na-na-nah

who said a black man in illuminati
last time i checked that was the biggest racist party
last time i checked, we was racing with marcus garvey
on the freeway to africa till i wreck my audi
and i want everybody to view my autopsy
so you can see exactly where the government had shot me
no conspiracy, my fate is inevitable
they play musical chairs once i'm on that pedestal
frightening, so fucking frightening
enough to drive a man insane, a woman insane
the reason lauryn hill don't sing, or kurt cobain
loaded that clip and then said bang, the drama it bring
is crazy, product of the late 80s
trying to stay above water, that's why we shun the navy
pull your guns and play me, let's set it off
cause a riot, throw a molotov
somebody told me them pirates had got lost
cause we been off them slave ships
got our own pyramids, write our own hieroglyphs

thug life
thug life

i met her at this house party on el segundo and central
she had the credentials of strippers in atlanta
ass came with a hump from the jump, she was a camel
i want to ride like arabians, push an '04 mercedes-benz
hello my name is kendrick she said no, you're handsome
whispered in my ear, disappeared then found her dancin'
ciara had played in the background
the parade music we made had us all wearin' shades now cool
where you stay she said down the street from dominguez high
okay, i know that's borderline compton or paramount  well is it compton
no she replied and quickly start battin' her eyes and
i strictly had wanted her thighs around me
seventeen with nothin' but pussy stuck on my mental
my motive was rather sinful, what you tryna get into
she didn't tell, just gave me her nextel
dropped the number, we chirped the whole summer and well
the summer had passed and now i'm likin' her
conversation we having probably enticin' her
who could imagine maybe my actions would end up wifin' her
love or lust, regardless we'll fuck cause the trife in us
it's deep rooted, the music of bein' young and dumb
it's never muted, in fact it's much louder where i'm from
we know a lot 'bout each other, her mother was a crack addict
she live with her granny and her younger two brothers
her favorite cousin demetrius's irrepetible
family history of gangbangin' did make me skeptical
but not enough to stop me from gettin' a nut
i wanna come over, what's up that's what i told her 
soon as this episode of martin go off, i'm tryin' to get off
i was in heat like a cactus, my tactics of bein' thirsty
probably could hurt me, but fuck it i got some heart
grab my momma's keys, hopped in the car, then oh boy
so now i'm down rosecrans in a caravan
passin' alameda, my gas meter in need of a pump
i got enough to get me through the traffic jam
at least i hope cause my pockets broke as a promise man
i'm thinkin' bout that sex   thinkin' bout her thighs 
or maybe kissin' on her neck or maybe what positions next
sent a picture of her titties blowin' up my texts
i looked at 'em and almost ran my front bumper into corvette
enthused by the touch of a woman, she's a masseuse
and i'm a professional porn star when off the goose
i had a fifth in the trunk like curtis jackson for ransom
i'm hopin' to get her loose like an uncle luke anthem
i'm two blocks away, 250 feet
and six steps from where she stay, she wavin' me 'cross the street
i pulled up a smile on my face, and then i see
two niggas, two black hoodies, i froze as my phone rang

uh, look inside of my soul and you can find gold and maybe get rich
look inside of your soul and you can find out it never exist
i can feel the changes, i can feel a new life
i always knew life can be dangerous  i can say that i like a challenge 
and you to me is painless, you don't know what pain is
how can i paint this picture when the color blind is hanging with you
fell on my face and awoke with a scar, another mistake living deep in my heart
wear it on top of my sleeve in a flick, i can admit that it did look like yours
why you resent every making of this, tell me your purpose is petty again
but even a small lighter can burn a bridge, even a small lighter can burn a bridge

i'm trying to keep it alive and not compromise the feeling we love
you're trying to keep it deprived and only co-sign what radio does
and i'm looking right past you  we live in a world, we live in a world 
on two different axles  you live in a world, you living behind the mirror
i know what you scared of, the feeling of feeling emotions inferior
this shit is vital, i know you had to  this shit is vital, i know you had to
to die in a pitiful vain, tell me a watch and a chain is way more believable
give me a feasible gain, rather a seasonal name  i'll let the people know 
this is something you can blame on yourselves you can remain, stuck in a box
i'mma break out and then hide every lock, i'mma break out and then hide every lock

uhh, martin had a dream
martin had a dream kendrick have a dream

money trees is the perfect place for shade and that's just how i feel

nah, nah  a dollar might just fuck your main bitch, that's just how i feel
nah  a dollar might say fuck them niggas that you came with, that's just how i feel
nah, nah  a dollar might, just make that lane switch, that's just how i feel
nah  a dollar might turn to a million and we all rich, that's just how i feel

dreams of livin' life like rappers do like rappers do
bump that new e-40 after school after school
you know big ballin' with my homies my homies
earl stevens had us thinkin' rational thinkin' rational
back to reality we poor, ya bish ya bish
another casualty at war, ya bish ya bish
two bullets in my uncle tony head uncle tony head
he said one day i'd be on tour, ya bish ya bish
that louis burger'll never be the same be the same
a louis belt will never ease that pain ease that pain
but i'ma purchase when that day is jerkin' day is jerkin'
pull off at church's with pirelli's skirtin' pirelli's skirtin'
gang signs out the window, ya bish ya bish
hopin' all of em offend you, ya bish ya bish
they say your hood is a pot of gold a pot of gold
and we gon' crash it when nobody's home

i recognize your fragrance hol' up
you ain't never gotta say shit woo
and i know your taste is
a little bit mmm high maintenance ooh
everybody else basic
you live life on an everyday basis
with poetic justice, poetic justice
if i told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room, would you trust it
i mean write poems in these songs dedicated to you
and you're in the mood for empathy, theres blood in my pen
better yet when your friends and them
i really wanna know you all
i really wanna show you off
fuck that, pour up plenty of champagne
cold nights when you curse this name
you called up your girlfriends and
y'all curled in that little bitty range i heard that
she wanna go and party, she wanna go and party
nigga don't approach her with that atari
nigga that ain't good game, homie, sorry
they say conversation, rule a nation, i can tell
but i can never right my wrongs
'less i write it down for real, ps

you can get it, you can get it
you can get it, you can get it
and i know just know just know just know just know just
what you want, poetic justice, put it in a song

every time i write these words they become a taboo
making sure my punctuation curve
every letter is true
living my life in the margin and that metaphor was proof
i'm talking poetic justice, poetic justice
if i told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room, would you trust it
i mean you need to hear this
love is not just a verb, it's you looking in the mirror
love is not just a verb, it's you looking poor maybe
call me crazy, we can both be insane
a fatal attraction is common
and what we have common is pain
i mean you need to hear this
love is not just a verb and i can see power steering
sex drive when you swerve, i want that interference
it's coherent, i can hear it, mmhmm
that's your heartbeat
it either caught me or it called me, mmhmm
breathe slow and you'll find gold mines in these lines
sincerely, yours truly
and right before you go blind
ps

look inside these walls and you see them havin' withdrawals
of a prisoner on his way
trapped inside your desire to fire bullets that stray
track attire just tell you i'm tired and ran away
i should ask a choir what do you require to sing a song that acquire me to have faith
as the record spin i should pray
for the record i recognize that i'm easily prey, i got ate alive yesterday
i got animosity building, it's probably big as a building
me jumpin' off of the roof is me just playin' it safe
but what am i supposed to do when the topic is red or blue
and you understand that i ain't but know i'm accustomed to
just a couple that look for trouble and live in the street with rank
no better picture to paint than me walking from bible study
and called his homies because he had said he noticed my face
from a function that tooken place, they was wonderin' if i bang
step on my neck and get blood on your nike checks
i don't mind because one day you'll respect, the good kid, maad city

all i see is strobe lights, blinding me in my hindsight
findin' me by myself, promise me you can help 
in all honesty i got time to be copacetic until
you had finally made decision to hold me against my will
it was like a head on collision that folded me standin' still
i can never pick out the difference and grade a cop on the bill
every time you clock in the morning, i feel you just want to kill
all my innocence while ignorin' my purpose to persevere as a better person
i know you heard this and probably in fear
but what am i supposed to do when the blinkin' of red and blue
flash from the top of your roof and your dog has to say woof
and you ask lift up your shirt cause you wonder if a tattoo
of affiliation can make it a pleasure to put me through
gang files but that don't matter because the matter is racial profile
i heard them chatter he's probably young but i know that he's down
step on his neck as hard as your bulletproof vest
he don't mind, he know we'll never respect, the good kid, maad city

all i see in this room, 20 xanies and these 'shrooms
grown-up candy for pain, can we live in a sane society
it's entirely stressful upon my brain
you hired me as a victim, i quietly hope for change
when violence is the rhythm inspired me to obtain
the silence in this room with 20 xanies and 'shrooms
some grown-up candy i lost it, i feel it's nothing to lose
the streets sure to release the worst side of my best
don't mind cause now you ever in debt, to good kid, maad city

if pirus and crips all got along 
they'd probably gun me down by the end of this song
seem like the whole city go against me
every time i'm in the street i hear yawk yawk yawk yawk

brace yourself, i'll take you on a trip down memory lane
this is not a rap on how i'm slingin crack or move cocaine
this is cul-de-sac and plenty cognac and major pain
not the drill sergeant but the stress that weighin' on your brain
it was me, l-boogs and yan-yan, yg, lucky ridin' down rosecrans
it got ugly, wavin' your hand out the window, check yo self
uh, warriors and conans, hope euphoria can slow dance 
with society, the driver seat the first one to get killed
seen a light-skinned nigga with his brains blown out
at the same burger stand where  hang out
now this is not a tape recorder sayin' that he did it
but ever since that day, i was lookin at him different
that was back when i was nine, joey packed the nine
pakistan on every porch is fine, we adapt to crime
pack a van with four guns at a time with the slidin' door, fuck is up
fuck you shootin' for if you ain't walkin' up, you fuckin' punk
pickin' up the fuckin' pump, pickin' off you suckers
suck a dick or die or sucker punch, a wall of bullets comin from
ak's, ar's, aye y'all, duck
that's what momma said when we was eatin' the free lunch
aw man, goddamn, all hell broke loose
you killed my cousin back in '94, fuck yo truce
now crawl yo head in that noose, you wind up dead on the news
ain't no peace treaty, just pieces, bg's up to pre-approve
bodies on top of bodies, iv's on top of iv's
obviously the coroner between the sheets like the isleys
when you hop on that trolley, make sure your colors correct
make sure you're corporate or they'll be callin' your mother collect
they say the governor collect, all of our taxes except
when we in traffic and tragic happens, that shit ain't no threat
you movin backwards if you suggest that you sleep with a tec
go buy a chopper and have a doctor on speed dial, i guess
maad city

fresh outta school cause i was a high school grad
sleepin' in the livin' room in my momma's pad
reality struck, i seen the white car crash
hit the light pole, two niggas hopped out on foot and dashed
my pops said i needed a job, i thought i believed him
security guard for a month and ended up leavin'
in fact i got fired because i was inspired by all of my friends
to stage a robbery the third saturday i clocked in
projects tore up, gang signs get thrown up
cocaine laced in marijuana
and they wonder why i rarely smoke now
imagine if your first blunt had you foamin' at the mouth
i was straight tweakin'  the next weekend we broke even
i made allegiance that made a promise to see you bleedin'
you know the reasons but still won't ever know my life
kendrick aka compton's human sacrifice

if i told you i killed a nigga at 16, would you believe me
or see me to be, innocent kendrick you seen in the street
with a basketball and some now   laters to eat
if i mentioned all of my skeletons, would you jump in the seat
would you say my intelligence now is great relief
and it's safe to say that our next generation maybe can sleep
with dreams of being a lawyer or doctor
instead of boy with a chopper that hold the cul-de-sac hostage
kill them all if they gossip, the children of the corn, they vandalizin'
the option of livin' a lie, drown their body with toxins
constantly drinkin' and drive, hit the powder 
then watch this flame that arrive in his eye, this a coward
the concept is aim and they bang it and slide, out that bitch with deposits
and the price on his head, the tithes, probably go to the projects
i, live inside the belly of the rough
compton, usa, made me an angel on angel dust, what

now i done grew up round some people living their life in bottles
granddaddy had the golden flask, back stroke every day in chicago
some people like the way it feels, some people wanna kill their sorrows
some people wanna fit in with the popular, that was my problem
i was in a dark room, loud tunes, looking to make a vow soon
that i'ma get fucked up, filling up my cup, i see the crowd move
changing by the minute, and the record on repeat
took a sip, then another sip, then somebody said to me

ok, now open your mind up and listen me kendrick
 i am your conscience, if you do not hear me then you will be history kendrick
 i know that you're nauseous right now, and i'm hoping to lead you to victory kendrick
if i take another one down, i'ma drown in some poison abusing my limit
i think that i'm feeling the vibe, i see the love in her eyes
i see the feeling, the freedom is granted as soon as the damage of vodka arrive
this how you capitalize, this is parental advice, then apparently
i'm over-influenced by what you are doing, i thought i was doing the most, then someone said to me

i ride, you ride, bang
one chopper, one-hundred shots, bang
hop out, do you, bang
two chopper, two-hundred shots, bang

when the lights shut off, and it's my turn
to settle down, my main concern
promise that you will sing about me
promise that you will sing about me
i said when the lights shut off, and it's my turn
to settle down, my main concern
promise that you will sing about me
promise that you will sing about me

i woke up this morning and figured i'd call you
in case i'm not here tomorrow, i'm hopin' that i can borrow
a peace of mind, i'm behind on what's really important
my mind is really distorted, i find nothin' but trouble in my life
i'm fortunate you believe in a dream
this orphanage we call a ghetto is quite a routine
and last night was just another distraction or a reaction
of what we consider madness, i know exactly what happened
you ran outside when you heard my brother cry for help
held him like a newborn baby and made him feel
like everything was alright and a fight he tried to put up
but the type of bullet that stuck had went against his will
as blood spilled on your hands, my plans rather vindictive
everybody's a victim in my eyes
when i ride it's a murderous rhythm and outside became pitch black
a demon glued to my back whispering get 'em
i got 'em, and i ain't give a fuck
that same mentality that told my brother not to duck
in actuality it's a trip how we trip off of colors
i wonder if i'll ever discover a passion like you and recover
the life that i knew as a young'n in pajamas and dun-ta-duns
when thunder comes, it rains cats and dogs
dumb niggas like me never prosper
prognosis of a problem child, i'm proud and well devoted
this piru shit been in me forever
so forever i'ma push it, wherever, whenever
and i love you cause you love my brother like you did
just promise me you'll tell this story when you make it big
and if i die before your album drop, i hope

you wrote a song about my sister on your tape
and called it section80, the message resembled brenda's got a baby
what's crazy was i was hearin about it
but doubted your ignorance, how could you ever just put her on blast and shit
judgin' her past and shit
well it's completely my future, her nigga behind me right now askin' for ass and shit
and i'ma need that 40 dollars
even if i gotta fuck, suck and swallow in the parking lot
gonzales park, i'm followed by a married man, a father of three
my titties bounce on the cadence of his tinglin' keys
matter of fact he my favorite cause he tip me with e's
he got a cousin named david and i seen him last week
this is the life of another girl damaged by the system
these foster homes, i run away and never do miss 'em
see my hormones just run away and if i can get 'em back
to where they used to be then i'll probably be in the denim
of a family gene that show women how to be woman
or better yet a leader, you need her to learn something
then you probably need to beat her, that's how i was taught
three niggas in one room, first time i was tossed
and i'm exhausted but fuck that sorry for your loss shit
my sister died in vain, but what point are you tryin' to gain
if you can't fit the pumps i walk in i'll wait
 your rebuttal a little too late
and if you have a album date, just make sure i'm not in the song
cause i don't need the attention bring enough of that on my own
and matter fact did i mention that i physically feel great
a doctor's approval is a waste of time, i know i'm straight
i'll probably live longer than you and never fade away
i'll never fade away, i'll never fade away, i know my fate
and i'm on the grind for this cake, i'ma get or die tryin'
i'm eyein' every male gender with intentions of buyin'  you lyin' to these motherfuckers, talkin' about you can help 'em
with my story, you can help me if you sell this pussy for me, nigga
don't ignore me nigga, fuck your glory nigga, this bullshit

sometimes i look in a mirror and ask myself
am i really scared of passing away it it's today i hope i hear a
cry out from heaven so loud it can water down a demon
with the holy ghost 'til it drown in the blood of jesus
i wrote some raps that make sure that my lifeline
rake in the scent of a reaper, ensuring that my allegiance
with the other side may come soon and if i'm doomed
may the wound help my mother be blessed for many moons
i suffer a lot and every day the glass mirror
get tougher to watch, i tie my stomach in knots
and i'm not sure why i'm infatuated with death
my imagination is surely an aggravation of threats
that can come about cause the tongue is mighty powerful
and i can name a list of your favorites that probably vouch
maybe cause i'm a dreamer and sleep is the cousin of death
really stuck in the scheme of wonderin' when i'ma rest
and you're right, your brother was a brother to me
and your sister's situation was the one that pulled me
in a direction to speak of something that's realer than the tv screen
by any means, wasn't tryin' to offend or come between
her personal life, i was like it need to be told
cursin' the life of 20 generations after her soul
exactly what'd happen if i ain't continued rappin'
or steady being distracted by money, drugs, and four
fives, i count lives all on these songs
look at the weak and cry, pray one day you'll be strong
fightin' for your rights, even when you're wrong
and hope that at least one of you sing about me when i'm gone
now am i worth it 
did i put enough work in

tired of runnin'  uh, tired of huntin'
uh, my own kind, but retirin' nothin'
uh, tires are steady screechin'  the driver is rubbin'
uh, hands on the wheel, uh, who said we wasn't
uh, dyin' of thirst, uh, dyin' of thirst, uh, dyin' of thirst

uh, dope on the corner, uh, look at the coroner

it's hard to channel your energy when you know you're crooked
uh, banana clip, split his banana puddin'
uh, i'm like tre, uh, that's cuba gooding
uh, i know i'm good at, uh, dyin' of thirst
uh, dyin' of thirst, uh, dyin' of thirst

uh, how many sins uh, i'm runnin' out
uh, how many sins uh, i lost count
dreams of ballin' like spalding but only shotty bounce
uh, the reaper callin'  uh, i'm cottonmouth
uh, money is power money is power yours is ours yours is ours
lay with a snitch, uh, die with a coward
uh, hope we get rich, uh, hope we can tower
uh, over the city with vanity with the music louder
uh, the same song, uh, a black flower
uh, i'll show you how to, uh, dye your thirst
uh, dye your thirst, uh, dye your thirst

uh, what are we doin' what are we doin' uh, who are we foolin' who are we foolin'
uh, hell is hot hell is hot uh, fire is proven fire is proven
uh, to burn for eternity, return of the student
that never learned how to live righteous but how to shoot it
uh, tired of runnin'  uh, choirs is hummin'
uh, tell us to visit, uh, we lyin' 'bout comin'
uh, now back to business, uh, loadin' the guns in
uh, back of the buick, your hood is feudin' and the beef is bubblin'
uh, it's no discussion, uh, hereditary
uh, all of my cousins, uh, dyin' of thirst
uh, dyin' of thirst, uh, dyin' of thirst

uh, too many sins, uh, i'm runnin' out
uh, somebody send me, a well for the drought
uh, see all i know, uh, is takin' notes
uh, on takin' this life for granted, granted if he provoke
uh, my best days, uh, i stress days 
lord forgive me for all my sins for i not know
my best days, uh, i stress days
uh, say fuck the world, uh, my sex slave
uh, money, pussy and greed  what's my next crave
whatever it is, know it's my next grave
uh, tired of runnin' tired of runnin' tired of runnin' tired of runnin'
tired of tumblin' tired of tumblin' tired of runnin' tired of runnin'
uh, tired of tumblin'
back once my momma said see a pastor, give me a promise
what if today was the rapture, and you completely tarnished
the truth will set you free so to me be completely honest
you dyin' of thirst, you dyin' of thirst
so hop in that water, and pray that it works

i promise that i know you very well
your eyes never lie even if they tell
sweet lullabies that come with a smell
of a dozen roses flippin' down the green hill
you living in a world that come with plan b
cause plan a never relay a guarantee
and plan c never could say just what it was
and your plans only can pan around love
you love him, you love them, you love her
you love so much, you love when love hurts
you love red bottom and gold with the sequin
you love hand-bag on the waist of your jean
you love french tip and trip that pay for
you love bank slip that tell you we paid more
you love a good hand whenever the card dealt
but what love got to do with it when you don't love yourself

i promise that i know you very well
your eyes never lie even if they fell
out the sky and your optics turn stale
where they mold that's green, i can see you fit the bill
of living in a world that come with plan b
cause plan a only can make another mistake
and you can't see success coming from plan c
when it all breaks, you'll still say you're lovely
and love them and love when you love her
you love so much, you love when love hurts
you love fast cars and dead presidents old
you love fast women, you love keepin' control
of everything that you love, you love beef
you love streets, you love runnin'  duckin' police
you love your hood, might even love it to death
but what love got to do with it, when you don't love yourself

the reason why i know you very well
cause we have the same eyes can't you tell
the days i tried to cover up and conceal
my pride, it only made it harder for me to deal
when living in a world that come with plan b
a scapegoat cause plan a don't come free
and plan c just an excuse like because
or the word but, but what if i got love
i love them, i love when i love her
i love so much, i love when love hurts
i love first verse cause you're the girl i attract
i love second verse cause you're the homie that packed
burner like a stove top, that love cooking from scratch
i love what the both of you have to offer
in fact, i love it so much, i don't love anything else
but what love got to do with it when i don't love myself
to the point i should hate everything i do love
should i hate living my life inside the club
should i hate her for watching me for that reason
should i hate him for telling me that i'm season
should i hate them for telling me ball out
should i hate street credibility i'm talkin' about
hatin' all money, power, respect in my will
or hating the fact none of that shit make me real

now everybody serenade the new faith of kendrick lamar
this is king kendrick lamar: king kendrick and i meant it
my point intended is raw
fix your lenses forensics would've told you kendrick had killed it
pretend it's a massacre and the masses upon us
and i mastered bein' the master at dodgin' your honor and the chapter that read at 25 
i would live dormant like five in the mornin'
they raid your spot while kendrick's performin' and if they take everything, know i got

so come and visit 
the tire screechin'  ambulance, policemen
won't you spend a weekend on rosecrans, nigga
khaki creasin'  crime increasin' on rosecrans, nigga  kendrick conan, nigga
where you sword at hand on the cross and swore that
i do it big as rasputia for them shooters, kama sutra scream 
fuck your position and make you hold that
i'm tryin' to stay grounded like four flats but i know flats and piru crip tats

then talked about it when crack hit the speakers, the music business
i blow up every time, we throw up a record
dependin' on what you expectin'  i'm sure it's bigger than your religion
perfected by niggas that manifested music to live in

now we can all celebrate
we can all harvest the rap artists of nwa
america target our rap market, it's controversy and hate
harsh realities we in made our music translate
to the coke dealers, the hood rich, and the broke niggas that play

this was brought to you by dre, now every motherfucker in here say

i used to be jealous of aaron afflalo
i used to be jealous of aaron afflalo, he was the one to follow
he was the only leader foreseeing brighter tomorrows
he would live in the gym
we was living in sorrow
total envy of him
he made a dream become a reality
actually making it possible to swim
his way out of compton with further more to accomplish
graduate with honors, a sponsor of basketball scholars
it's 2004 and i'm watching him score 30
remember vividly how them victory points had hurt me
cause every basket was a reaction or a reminder
that we was just moving backwards
the bungalow where you find us
the art of us ditching classes heading nowhere fast
stick my head inside the study hall, he focused on math
determination ambition, plus dedication and wisdom
qualities he was given was the shit we didn't have
dug inside of his book bag and coach palmer asked for his finals
he had his back like a spinal meanwhile
we singing the same old song spinning the vinyl
11 graders gone wrong
he focused on the nba we focused on some patron
now watch that black boy fly

i used to jealous of jayceon
i used to jealous of jayceon, taylor when i was young
taylor made a career out of music from writing songs
a buick had driven past bumping him when i mowed the lawn
money laundering hustling, homies pondering up against
schemes to make a million even if doing you harm
war's the case and just in case you wasn't alarmed
the city had fought with firearms and many had died before dawn
its 2004 and i'm hearing the people roar
for the name of the game they line in front of the store
swap meets selling our mixtapes i'm like oh shit, wait
don't wanna be another nigga stuck regretting mistakes
mixed feelings was my opinion i was defending my insecurities
chillin my conscience next to a villain
compton made you believe success wasn't real
be honest, none of us knew of a record deal
so as i peel through these lottery tickets
i see a harley davidson truck visit the same plaza we shopped
a tall nigga hopped out with jordans and a white tank top
he was top of the rap game, we was the top of the block
so watch that black boy fly

my mama didn't raise me up to be jealous-hearted
like most of the winners call it
regardless of where you stay, hold your head and continue marching
that's what she said but in my head i wanted to be like jordan
a boy touring the country with money from mic recording
the only way out the ghetto, you know the stereotype
shooting hoops or live on the stereo like top 40
and shortly, i got discouraged
like every time i walked to the corner had them guns bursting
nigga, i was rehearsing in repetition the phrase
only one in a million will ever see better days
especially when the crime waves was bigger than tsunamis
break your boogie boards to pieces you just a typical homy
all these niggaz facetious and they all standing beside me
they all will buy me a chopper if any one of you try me
what am i to do when every neighborhood is an obstacle
when 2 niggaz making it out had never sounded logical
3 niggaz making it out, that's mission impossible
so i never believed the type of performance that i could do
i wasn't jealous cuz of the talents they got
i was terrified they'll be the last black boys to fly
out of compton

thank god
black boy fly, watch that black boy fly

waking up in a dream
sleepwalking on another big stage
you never heard peace 'til you hear people scream
your name and your song, i'm so far away
from the place i used to be, struggling usually
look at the newer me, fate pursuing me
i can feel the energy in the air
it feel like i'm supposed to be here

a fool if i take it all for granted
a smart man if i keep my feet planted to the earth
cuz the people that hurt can't understand it
you speakin outlandish, i'm ashamed how to make it all work
another planet, it's a short term role for me
i rec it's all for me, it's just mo with me
and you're here for you too here can re-persevere
defenses, i yet feel relentless
ambition with a clear vision
takin off, i ain't takin off these pistons
i'm takin off on the enemies, your distance
came across me, how much it'd cost me to get you out my business
i said a planet is a shortterm goal, no sky is the limit
i'm past that, now pass that
a word not one but 4 times 2 plus yours

you're looking at me and tell me i'm blessed
calculating my steps, my heart, my breath
breath lungs of a victory and vividly you see me when i'm at my best, my worse
this verse is dedicated to the days that i slept with the curse
research my paid dues, i'm reimbursed
i burst in the crowd with a voice and a crown
i'm a king on a prowl and i see mama smile
and the vow i'mma take that i'll never break
you can break bread with me now, we can all take a bow
on the edge of the pedestal and scream out loud
that we made it off the avenue, i walk then down in the darkness
i often sit back and get lost in the rap that i root
when you told me that it spoke to your soul
i was talkin to you, i was walkin it through
heavy ghetto, tail of success, hello

all i all i all i all i have in life is my new appetite for failure
and i got hunger pain that grow insane
tell me do that sound familiar
if it do then you're like me make an excuse that your relief
is in the bottom of a bottle and the greenest indo leaf
as the window open i release everything
that corrodes inside of me 
i see you joke and while you laugh don't you feel bad
i'll probably sleep and never ever wake up
never ever wake up never ever wake up
in god i trust, but just when i thought i had enough

more more bloody more we gon' drink this muhfucka down
more bottoms up then we pass it round more
fill it up more, not enough more
bloody more we gon drink this muhfucka down more
bottoms up then we pass it round more
fill it up more, not enough more
fill it up more, not enough more
fill it up more, not enough more

momma take this motherfuckin block off
tryna reach you every day, collect calls
never get through when i go through withdrawals
say who told you that i wanted this door
to slam shut, i just wanted to vent or
ask you if you can give me your rent for
a attorney, i can pay you back more
soon as i get out, yeah every rack is yours
commissary runnin low, i need help

momma take this motherfuckin block off

pulled up and they put me in them cop cars
please believe me, this ain't easy by far
you forgot you're talkin to your only son
'member when you put me in that relay run
i was racin, chasin dreams to be the best
you had taught me that the very day i won
all i need is you to give me same support
investigation sayin that the same report
from a witness just might testify in court
da say i take a deal or take a loss
i ain't built for all them god damn numbers
god's will, say a prayer for me momma
if you can't then open up the phone lines
momma just get back at me this last time

dante, if i stress to take the block off
that's the day the state had take them locks off
i can only help but do so much
betterin yourself, your own crutch
look at your reflection, tell me who you see
who is your protection g-o-d
no it's not neglection, i have just accepted
your fate and what it's gon' be
'member all the nights that i cried
thinking that my only son just died
peeking through the window, kicking through the door
it's you they looking for, raid outside
rather see you locked up than dead
only you would say that i'm selfish
so before i take the stand and put this bible in my hand
son, let me say this

i am a sinner, who's probably gonna sin again
lord forgive me, lord forgive me, things i don't understand
sometimes i need to be alone bitch, don't kill my vibe  bitch, don't kill my vibe

i am the bad, the good guy, the last the hood got, the last that would try to pass a good job
if shawn's a black beatle then i need a ten second drum solo, bitch see you at woodstock, ah

now i done grew up round some people livin' their life in bottles
granddaddy had the golden flask, back stroke every day in chicago
some people like the way it feels, some people wanna kill their sorrows
some people wanna fit in with the popular, that was my problem
i was in a dark room, loud tunes, looking to make a vow soon
that i'ma get fucked up, fillin' up my cup, i see the crowd move
changin' by the minute, and the record on repeat
took a sip then another sip, then somebody said to me

nigga, why you babysittin' only two or three shots
i'ma show you how to turn it up a notch
first you get a swimming pool full of liquor then you dive in it
pool full of liquor then you dive in it

king kunta   everybody wanna cut the legs off him
kunta   black man takin' no losses aw yeah
bitch where you when i was walkin'
now i run the game, got the whole world talkin'
king kunta   everybody wanna cut the legs off him
when you got the yams what's the yams

the yam is the power that be   you can smell it when i'm walkin' down the street
oh yes we can, oh yes we can i can dig rappin'  but a rapper with a ghostwriter, what the fuck happened
oh no  i swore i wouldn't tell
but most of y'all share bars like you got the bottom bunk in a two-man cell a two-man cell
somethin's in the water somethin's in the water
and if i got a brown nose for some gold then i'd rather be a bum than a motherfuckin' baller

the yam brought it out of richard pryor   manipulated bill clinton with desires
 24 7, 365 days times two
i was contemplatin' gettin' on stage
just to go back to the hood, see my enemies and say

i was gonna kill a couple rappers but they did it to themselves
everybody's suicidal, they don't even need my help
this shit is elementary, i'll probably go to jail
if i shoot at your identity and bounce to the left
stuck a flag in my city, everybody's screamin' compton
i should probably run for mayor when i'm done to be honest
and i put that on my mama and my baby boo too
twenty million walkin' out the court buildin'  woo woo
ah yeah, fuck the judge
i made it past twenty-five and there i was
a little nappy headed nigga with the world behind him
life ain't shit but a fat vagina
screamin' annie, are you okay annie, are you okay
limo tinted with the gold plates
straight from the bottom, this the belly of the beast
from a peasant to a prince to a motherfuckin' king

bitch where was you when i was- 
by the time you hear the next pop, the funk shall be within you
 now i run the game got the whole world talkin'
king kunta   everybody wanna cut the legs off him
king kunta   black man takin' no losses aw yeah
bitch where was you when i was walkin'
now i run the game got the whole world talkin'
king kunta   everybody wanna cut the legs off him

i remember you was conflicted, misusin' your influence

what money got to do with it
when i don't know the full definition of a rap image
i'm trapped inside the ghetto and i ain't proud to admit it
institutionalized, i keep runnin back for a visit
hol' up, get it back
i said i'm trapped inside the ghetto and i ain't proud to admit it
institutionalized, i can still kill me a nigga, so what

life can be like, a box of choc-o-late
quid pro quo, somethin for somethin, that's the obvious
oh shit, flow's so sick, don't you swallow it
bitin my style, you're salmonella poison positive
i can just, alleviate the rap industry politics
milk the game up, never lactose-intolerant
the last remainder of real shit, you know the obvious
me scholarship no, streets put me through colleges
be all you can be, true, but the problem is
a dream's only a dream if, work, don't follow it
remind me of the homies that used to know me, now follow this
i'll tell you my hypothesis, i'm prol'ly just way too loyal
k-dizzle would do it for you, my niggaz think i'm a god
truthfully all of 'em spoiled, usually you're never charged
but somethin came over you once i took you to them fuckin bet awards
you lookin at artists like the harvests
so many rollies around you and you want all of 'em
somebody told me you thinkin 'bout snatchin jewelry
i shoulda listened what my grandmomma said to me

fuck am i s'posed to do when i'm lookin' at walkin licks
the constant big money talk about mansions and foreign whips
the private jets and passports, presidential glass floor
gold bottles, gold models stiffen up the ass for
instagram flicks, suckin dick, fuck is this
one more suck away from wavin flashy wrist
my defense, mechanism tell me to get him, quickly because he got it
it's the recession, then why the fuck he in king of diamonds
no more livin poor, meet my 44
when i see 'em, put the per diem on the floor
now kendrick, know they your co-workers
but it's gon' take a lot for this pistol go cold turkey
now i can watch his watch on the tv and be okay
but see i'm on the clock once that watch landin in la
remember steal from the rich and givin it back to the poor
well that's me at these awards i guess my grandmomma was warnin a boy, she said

if these walls can talk, they'd tell me to swim good
no boat, i float better than he would
no life jacket, i'm not the god of nazareth
but your flood can be misunderstood
wall tellin me they full of pain, resentment
need someone to live in them just to relieve tension
me i'm just a tenant
landlord said these walls vacant more than a minute
these walls are vulnerable, exclamation
interior pink, color coordinated
i interrogated every nook and cranny
i mean it's still amazing, before they couldn't stand me
these walls want to cry tears
these walls happier when i'm here
these walls never could hold up
every time i come around, demolition might

if these walls can talk, they'd tell me to go deep
yellin at me continuously i can see
your defense mechanism is my decision
knock these walls down, that's my religion
walls feelin like they ready to close in
i suffocate then catch my second wind
i resonate in these walls
i don't know how long i can wait in these walls
i've been on these streets too long
lookin at you from the outside in
they sing the same old song
about how they walls are always the cleanest
i beg to differ, i must've missed them
i'm not involved, i'd rather diss them
i'd rather call on you, put your wall up
cause when i come around demolition gon'

if your walls can talk, they'd tell you it's too late
your destiny accepted your fate
burn accessories and stash 'em on the yard
take the recipe, the bible and god
wall tellin you that commissary is low
race wars happenin, no callin co
no calling your mother to save you
homies to say you're reputable, not acceptable
your behavior is sammy the bull-like   a killer that turned snitch
walls is tellin me you a bitch
you pray for appeals hopin the warden would afford them
that sentence so important
walls tellin you to listen to sing about me
retaliation is strong, you even dream about me
killed my homeboy and god spared your life
dumb criminal got indicted same night
so when you play this song, rewind the first verse
about me abusin my power so you can hurt
about me and her in the shower whenever she horny
about me and her in the after hours of the morning
about her baby daddy currently servin life
and how she think about you until we meet up at night
about the only girl that cared about you when you asked her
and how she fuckin on a famous rapper
walls can talk, talk

i remember you was conflicted, misusing your influence
 sometimes i did the same, abusing my power full of resentment
 resentment that turned into a deep depression
 found myself screaming in a hotel room

i place blame on you still, place shame on you still
feel like you ain't shit, feel like you don't feel
confidence in yourself, breakin on marble floors
watchin anonymous strangers tellin me that i'm yours
but you ain't shit i'm convinced your tolerance nothin special
what can i blame you for nigga, i can name several
situation had stopped with your little sister bakin
a baby inside, just a teenager, where's your patience
where's your antennas, where is the influence you speak of
you preached in front of 100,000 but never reached her
i fuckin tell you, you fuckin failure, you ain't no leader
i never liked you, forever despise you, i don't need you
the world don't need you, don't let them deceive you
numbers lie too, fuck your pride too, that's for dedication
thought money would change you, made you more complacent
i fuckin hate you, i hope you embrace it, i swear

are you the reason why momma and 'nem leavin
no you ain't shit, you say you love 'em, i know you don't mean it
i know you're irresponsible, selfish, in denial, can't help it
your trials and tribulations a burden, everyone felt it
everyone heard it, multiple shots, corners cryin out
you was deserted, where was your antennas again
where was yo' presence, where was yo' support that you pretend
you ainâ  t no brother, you ainâ  t no disciple, you ainâ  t no friend
a friend never leave compton for profit, or leave his best friend
lil' brother, you promised you'd watch him before they shot him
where was your antennas on the road, bottles and bitches
you faced time the one time, that's unforgiven
you even facetimed instead of a hospital visit
you should thought he would recover well
third surgery, they couldn't stop the bleeding, for real
then he died, god himself will say you fuckin failed you ain't try



i know yo' secrets nigga, mood swings is frequent, nigga
i know depression is restin on yo' heart for two reasons, nigga
i know you and a couple block boys ain't been speakin, nigga
y'all damn near beefin, i seen it and you're the reason, nigga
and if this bottle could talk 
i cry myself to sleep, bitch everything is your fault
faults breakin to pieces, earthquakes on every weekend
because you shook as soon as you knew confinement was needed
i know yo' secrets, don't let me tell them to the world
about that shit you thinkin, and that time you-  i'm 'bout to hurl
i'm fucked up, but i ain't as fucked up as you
you just can't get right, i think yo' heart made of bulletproof
shoulda killed yo' ass a long time ago
you shoulda felt that black revolver blast a long time ago
and if those mirrors could talk, it would say you gotta go
and if i told your secrets, the world'll know money can't stop a suicidal weakness

uh, and when i wake up
i recognize you're lookin at me for the pay cut
but homicide be lookin at you from the face down
when mac-11 even boom with the bass down   schemin
and let me tell you 'bout my life
painkillers only put me in the twilight
where pretty pussy and benjamin is the highlight
now tell my momma i love her but this what i like, lord knows
20 of 'em in my chevy, tell 'em all to come and get me
reapin everything i sow, so my karma come
and heaven, no preliminary hearing, so my record
and my motherfuckin gang stands silence for the record, uih
tell the world, i know it's too late
boys and girls, i think i've gone crazy
drown inside my vices all day
won't you please believe when i say

what you want you a house you a car
forty acres and a mule a piano, a guitar
anything, see, my name is lucy, i'm your dog
motherfucker, you can live at the mall
i can see the evil, i can tell it, i know when it's illegal
i don't think about it, i deposit every other zero
thinkin of my partner put the candy painted on the regal
diggin in my pocket, ain't a profit big enough to feed you
everyday my logic, get another dollar just to keep you
in the presence of your chico    ah
i don't talk about it, be about it, everyday i see cool
if i got it then you know you got it, heaven, i can reach you
pet dog, pet dog, pet dog, my dog, that's all
pick back and chat, i trap the back for y'all
i rap, i black on track and rest assured
my rights, my wrongs i write 'til i'm right with god

i remember you took me to the mall last week ba-baaaay
you looked me in my eyes 'bout fo' or five times
'til i was hypnotized then you clarified that i want yoooooou
you said sherane ain't got nothin on lucy, i said you cra-zay
roses are red violets are blue, but me and you both pushing up daisies if i want yoooooou

you said to me
you said your name was lucy
i said, where's ricardo you said, oh no, not the show
then you spit a lil' rap to me like this when i turned 26 i was like, oh shit
you said to me   i remember what you said, too   you said,
my name is lucy, kendrick, you introduced me, kendrick
 usually i donâ  t do this but i see you and me, kendrick
 lucy give you no worries, lucy got million stories
 about these rappers i came after when they was boring
 lucy gon' fill your pockets, lucy gon' move your momma
 out of compton inside the gi-gantic mansion like i promised
 lucy just want your trust and loyalty, avoidin me
 it's not so easy, i'm at these functions accordingly
 kendrick, lucy don't slack a minute, lucy work harder
 lucy gon' call ya even when lucy know you love your father
 i'm lucy, i loosely heard prayers on your first album
 truly, lucy don't mind cause at the end of the day you'll pursue me
 lucy go get it, lucy not timid, lucy up front
 lucy got paper work on top of paper work i want
 you to know that lucy got you, all your life i watched you
 and now you all grown up then sign this contract if thatâ  s possible

this feeling is unmatched
this feeling is brought to you by adrenaline and good rap
black pendleton ball cap west, west, west
we don't share the same synonym, fall back west, west, west
been in it before internet had new acts
mimickin radio's nemesis may be wack
my innocence limited, the experience lacked
ten of us with no tentative tactic that cracked
the mind of a literate writer, but i did it in fact
you admitted it once i submitted it wrapped in plastic
remember scribblin scratchin dilligent sentences backwards
visitin freestyle cyphers for your reaction
now i can live in a stadium, pack it the fastest
gamblin benjamin benefits, sinnin in traffic
spinnin women in cartwheels, linen fabric on fashion
winnin in, every decision, kendrick is master that mastered it
isn't it, lovely how menaces turned attraction
pivotin rappers, finish your fraction while writin blue magic
thank god for rap, i would say it got me a plaque
but what's better than that the fact it brought me back home

i know everything i know everything, know myself
i know morality, spirituality, good and bad health
i know fatality might haunt you, i know everything
i know compton, i know street shit, i know shit that's conscious
i know everything, i know lawyers, advertisement and sponsors
i know wisdom, i know bad religion, i know good karma
i know everything, i know history, i know the universe works mentally
i know the perks of bullshit isn't meant for me
i know everything, i know cars, clothes, hoes and money
i know loyalty, i know respect, i know those that's ornery
i know everything, the highs to lows to groupies and junkies
i know if i'm generous at heart, i don't need recognition
the way i'm rewarded, well that's god's decision
i know you know that lines from compton school district
just give it to the kids, donâ  t gossip about how it was distributed
i know how people work
i know the price of life, i'm knowin how much itâ  s worth
i know what i know and i know it well not to ever forget
until i realized i didnâ  t know shit, the day i came home

i met a little boy that resembled my features
nappy afro, gap in his smile
hand-me-down sneakers bounced through the crowd
run a number on man and woman that crossed him
sun beamin on his beady beads exhausted
tossin footballs with his ashy black ankles
breakin new laws momma passed on home trainin
he looked at me and said, kendrick you do know my language
 you just forgot because of what public schools had painted
 oh i forgot, don't kill my vibe, that's right, you're famous
 i used to watch on channel 5, tv was taken
 but never mind, you're here right now don't you mistake it
 it's just a new trip, take a glimpse at your family's ancestor
 make a new list, of everything you thought was progress
 and that was bullshit, i mean your life is full of turmoil
 you spoiled by fantasies of who you are, i feel bad for you
 i can attempt, to enlighten you without frightenin you
 if you resist, i'll back off quick, go catch a flight or two
 but if you pick, destiny over rest in peace
 then be an advocate, tell your homies especially to come back home

maybe only the wealthy get to know how you feel 
maybe i'm paranoid, ha, maybe i don't need you anyway
don't lie to me i'm suicidal anyway, i can be your advocate
i can preach for you if you tell me what the matter is

now you double up, time to bubble up the bread and huddle up
stickin to the scripts, now hip, them benjamins gon' cuddle up
skip   hop   drip   drop
flip   flop with the white tube sock
it goes sherrrrm sticks, burrrrrrn this
that's what the product smell like when the chemicals mix

el cos, monte carlos, road kings and dressers
rip ridaz, p-funkers, mexicans, they fuck with you
asians, they fuck with you, nobody can't fuck with you

hopped out the caddy, just got my dick sucked
the little homies called, they said, the enemies done cliqued up
oh yeah puto want to squabble with mi barrio
oh yeah tell 'em they can run it for the cardio
oh yeah everything is everything, it's scandalous
slow motion for the ambulance, the project filled with cameras
the lapd gamblin, scramblin, football numbers slanderin
niggaz name on paper, you snitched all summer
streets don't fail me now
they tell me it's a new gang in town
from compton   to congress, set trippin all around
ain't nothin' new but a flow of new demo-crips and re-blood-licans
red state versus a blue state, which one you governin
they give us guns and drugs, call us thugs, make it they promise to fuck with you
no condom they fuck with you, obama say, what it do
obama say what it do obama say what it do

everybody wanna talk about who this and who that
who the realest and who wack, or who white and who black
critics want to mention that they miss when hip-hop was rappin
motherfucker if you did, then killer mike'd be platinum
y'all priorities fucked up, put energy in wrong shit
hennessy and crown vic, my memory been gone since
don't ask about no camera blockin at award shows
no don't ask about my bitch, no don't ask about my foes
'less you askin me about power, yeah i got a lot of it
i'm the only nigga next to snoop that can push the button
had the coast on standby â  k dot, what up i heard they opened up
 pandora's box, i box 'em all in, by a landslide
nah homie we too sensitive, it spill out to the streets
i make the call and get the coast involved then history repeats
but i resolved inside that private hall while sittin down with jay
he said it's funny how one verse could fuck up the game

how much a dollar really cost
the question is detrimental, paralyzin my thoughts
parasites in my stomach keep me with a gut feeling, y'all
gotta see how i'm chillin once i park this luxury car
hoppin out feeling big as mutombo, twenty on pump six dirty
marcellus called me dumbo twenty years ago, can't forget
now i can lend 'em a ear or two, how to stack these residuals
tenfold, the liberal concept that what men'll do
twenty-oh-six, he didn't hear me
indigenous african only spoke zulu, my american tongue was slurry
walked out the gas station, a homeless man with a semi-tan complexion
asked me for ten rand, stressin about dry land
deep water, powder blue skies that crack open
a piece of crack that he wanted, i knew he was smokin
he begged and pleaded, asked me to feed him twice, i didn't believe it
told him, beat it contributin money just for his pipe, i couldn't see it
he said, my son, temptation is one thing that i've defeated
listen to me, i want a single bill from you   nothin less, nothin more
i told him i ain't have it then closed my door, tell me how much a dollar cost

he's starin at me in disbelief
my temper is buildin, he's starin at me, i grab my key
he's starin at me, i started the car, then i tried to leave
and somethin told me to keep it in park until i can see
the reason why he was mad at a stranger like i was supposed to save him
like i'm the reason he's homeless and askin me for a favor
he's starin at me, his eyes followed me with no laser
he's starin at me, i notice that his stare is contagious
cause now i'm starin back at him, feelin some type of disrespect
if i could throw a bat at him, it'd be aimin at his neck
i never understood someone beggin for goods
askin for handouts, takin it if they could
and this particular person just had it down pat
starin at me for the longest until he finally asked
have you ever opened up exodus 14
 'a humble man is all that we ever need'  tell me how much a dollar cost

guilt trippin and feelin resentment
i never met a transient that demanded attention
they got me frustrated, indecisive and power trippin
sour emotions got me lookin at the universe different
i should distance myself, i should keep it relentless
my selfishness is what got me here, who the fuck i'm kiddin
so i'ma tell you like i told the last bum, crumbs and pennies
i need all of mines, and i recognize this type of panhandlin all the time
i got better judgment, i know when niggaz hustlin
keep in mind, when i was strugglin, i did compromise
now i comprehend, i smell grandpa's old medicine
reekin from your skin, moonshine and gin
nigga you're babblin, your words ain't flatterin, i'm imaginin
denzel but lookin at o'neal, kazaam your sad thrills
your gimmick is mediocre, the jig is up
i seen you from a mile away losin' focus
and i'm insensitive, and i lack empathy
he looked at me and said, your potential is bittersweet
i looked at him and said, every nickel is mines to keep
he looked at me and said, know the truth, it'll set you free
 you're lookin at the messiah, the son of jehovah, the higher power
 the choir that spoke the word, the holy spirit, the nerve
 of nazareth, and i'll tell you just how much a dollar cost
 the price of having a spot in heaven, embrace your loss, i am god

uh
dark as the midnight hour or bright as the mornin sun
give a fuck about your complexion, i know what the germans done
sneak dissin
sneak me through the back window, i'm a good field nigga
i made a flower for you outta cotton just to chill witcha
you know i'd go the distance, you know i'm ten toes down
even if massa listenin, cover your ears, he 'bout to mention

uh
dark as the midnight hour, i'm bright as the morning sun
brown-skinned, but your blue eyes tell me your momma can't run
sneak dissin
sneak me through the back window, i'm a good field nigga
i made a flower for you outta cotton just to chill witcha
you know i'd go the distance, you know i'm ten toes down
even if massa listenin, i got the world's attention
so i'mma say somethin that's vital and critical for survival
of mankind, if he lyin, color should never rival
beauty is what you make it, i used to be so mistaken
by different shades of faces, then wit told me,
a woman is woman, love the creation
it all came from god then you was my confirmation, i came to where you reside
and looked around to see more sights for sore eyes
let the willie lynch theory reverse a million times with

six in the morn'  fire in the street
burn baby burn, that's all i wan' see
and sometimes i get off watchin you die in vain
it's such a shame, they may call me crazy
they may say i suffer from schizophrenia or somethin
but homie you made me
black don't crack, my nigga
my nigga, my nigga, my nigga, my nigga
my nigga, my nigga, my nigga, my nigga

i'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015
once i finish this witnesses will convey just what i mean
been feelin this way since i was 16, came to my senses
you never liked us anyway, fuck your friendship, i meant it
i'm african-american
i'm african, i'm black as the moon, heritage of a small village, pardon my residence
came from the bottom of mankind
my hair is nappy, my dick is big, my nose is round and wide
you hate me, don't you you hate my people
your plan is to terminate my culture, you're fuckin evil
i want you to recognize that i'm a proud monkey
you vandalize my perception but can't take style from me
and this is more than confession
i mean i might press the button just so you know my discretion
i'm guardin my feelings   i know that you feel it
you sabotage my community makin a killin
you made me a killer, emancipation of a real nigga

i'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015
once i finish this witnesses will convey just what i mean
i mean it's evident that i'm irrelevant to society
that's what you're tellin me, penitentiary would only hire me
curse me 'til i'm dead
church me with your fake prophesizin that i'ma be just another slave in my head
institutionalize, manipulation and lies
reciprocation of freedom only live in your eyes
you hate me, don't you i know you hate me just as much as you hate yourself
jealous of my wisdom and cards i dealt
watchin me as i pull up, fill up my tank, then peel out
muscle cars like pull-ups, show you what these big wheels 'bout
ah, black and successful, this black man meant to be special
cat scans on my radar bitch, how can i help you
how can i tell you i'm makin a killin
you made me a killer, emancipation of a real nigga

i'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015
when i finish this if you listen then sure you will agree
this plot is bigger than me, it's generational hatred
it's genocism, it's grimy, little justification
i'm african-american
i'm african, i'm black as the heart of a fuckin aryan
i'm black as the name of tyrone and darius, excuse my french
but fuck you, no fuck y'all that's as blunt as it gets
i know you hate me, don't you you hate my people
i can tell cause it's threats when i see you, i can tell cause your way's deceitful
know i can tell because you're in love with that desert eagle
thinkin maliciously, he get a chain then you gon' bleed him
it's funny how zulu and xhosa might go to war
two tribal armies that wanna build and destroy
remind me of these compton crip gangs that live next door
beefin with pirus, only death settle the score
so don't matter how much i say i like to preach with the panthers
or tell georgia state marcus garvey got all the answers
or try to celebrate february like it's my b-day
or eat watermelon, chicken and kool-aid on weekdays
or jump high enough to get michael jordan endorsements
or watch bet cause urban support is important
so why did i weep when trayvon martin was in the street
when gang bangin make me kill a nigga blacker than me
hypocrite

i could spot you a mile away
i could see your insecurities written all on your face
so predictable your words, i know what you gonna say
who you foolin oh, you assuming you can just come and hang
with the homies but your level of realness ain't the same
circus acts only attract those that entertain
small talk, we know that it's all talk
we live in the laugh factory every time they mention your name

and the world don't respect you
and the culture don't accept you but you think it's all love
and the girls gon' neglect you once your parody is done
reputation can't protect you if you never had one
jealousy complex, emotional complex
self-pity complex, under oath complex
the loudest one in the room, nigga, that's a complex
let me put it back in proper context

what do you got to offer
tell me before we off ya, put you deep in the coffin
been allergic to talkin, been a virgin to bullshit
and sell a dream in the auction, tell me just who your boss is
niggaz be fugazi, bitches be fugazi
this is for fugazi, niggaz and bitches
who make habitual lyin babies, bless them little hearts
you can never persuade me, you can never relate me
to him him, to her her, or that that or them them
or you you, the truth truth you love love to bend bend
in the back back, in the bed bed, on the floor, that's yo' ho
on the couch couch, in her mouth mouth, i'll be out, really doe

sound like i needed some soul searchin'
my pops gave me some game in real person
retraced my steps on what they never taught me
did my homework fast before government caught me
so i'm a dedicate this one verse to oprah
on how the infamous, sensitive n-word control us
so many artists gave her an explanation to hold us
well this is my explanation straight from ethiopia
n-e-g-u-s definition: royalty
king royalty   wait listen
n-e-g-u-s description: black emperor
king, ruler, now let me finish
the history books overlooked the word and hide it
america tried to make it to a house divided
the homies don't recognize, we be using it wrong
so i'ma break it down and put my game in the song
n-e-g-u-s, say it with me
or say no more  black stars can come and get me
take it from oprah winfrey, tell her she right on time
kendrick lamar, by far, realest negus alive

uh, yeah, uh, yeah
uh yeah, uh

the ghost of mandela, hope my flows they propel it
let these words be your earth and moon, you consume every message
as i lead this army, make room for mistakes and depression
and with that being said my nigga, let me ask this question
when shit hit the fan, is you still a fan
when shit hit the fan one-two, one-two
uh, when shit hit the fan, is you still a fan
when shit hit the fan, is you still a fan
the ghost of mandela, hope my flows they propel it
let these words be your earth and moon, you consume every message
as i lead this army, make room for mistakes and depression
and with that being said my nigga, let me ask this question

when shit hit the fan, is you still a fan
when shit hit the fan, is you still a fan
won't you look to your left and right make sure you ask your friends
when shit hit the fan, is you still a fan

do you believe in me are you deceivin' me
could i let you down easily is your heart where it need to be
is your smile on permanent is your vow on lifetime
would you know where the sermon is if i died in this next line
if i'm tried in a court of law, if the industry cut me off
if the government want me dead, plant cocaine in my car
would you judge me a drug kid or see me as k lamar
or question my character and degrade me on every blog
want you to love me like nelson, want you to hug me like nelson
i freed you from being a slave in your mind, you're very welcome
you tell me my song is more than a song, it's surely a blessing
but a prophet ain't a prophet 'til they ask you this question

the ghost of mandela, hope my flows they propel it
let these words be your earth and moon, you consume every message
as i lead this army, make room for mistakes and depression
and with that

do you believe in me how much you believe in her
you think she gon' stick around if them 25 years occur
you think he can hold you down when you down behind bars hurt
you think y'all on common ground if you promise to be there first
can you be immortalised without your life being expired
even though you share the same blood, is it worth the time
like who got your best interest like how much are you dependent
how clutch are the people that say they love you and who pretendin'
how tough is your skin when they turn you in do you show forgiveness
what brush do you bend when dustin' your shoulders from bein' offended
what kind of den did they put you in when the lions start hissin'
what kind of bridge did they burn revenge on your mind when it's mentioned
you wanna love like nelson, you wanna be like nelson
you wanna walk in in his shoes but you peace-makin' seldom
you wanna be remembered that delivered the message
that considered the blessing of everyone, this your lesson for everyone, say

the voice of mandela, hope my flows they propel it
let these words be your earth and moon, you consume every message
as i lead this army make room for mistakes and depression
and if you ridin' with me, nigga

i been wrote off before, i got abandonment issues
i hold grudges like bad judges, don't let me resent you
that's not nelson-like, want you to love me like nelson
i went to robben's island analyzin'  that's where his cell is
so i could find clarity, like how much you cherish me
is this relationship a fake or real as the heavens be
see i got to question it all, family, friends, fans, cats, dogs
trees, plants, grass, how the wind blow
murphy's law, generation x, will i ever be your x
floss off a baby step, mauled by the mouth of pitbulls, put me under stress
crawled under rocks, ducking y'all, itâ  s respect
but then tomorrow, put my back against the wall
how many leaders you said you needed then left 'em for dead
is it moses is it huey newton or detroit red
is it martin luther, jfk, shooter, you assassin
is it jackie is it jesse oh i know, it's michael jackson
oh when shit hit the fan, is you still a fan
when shit hit the fan, is you still a fan
that nigga gave us billie jean, you say he touched those kids
when shit hit the fan, is you still a fan

the ghost of mandela, hope my flows they propel it
let my words be your earth and moon, you consume every message
as i lead this army, make room for mistakes and depression
and if you ridin' with me nigga, let me ask this question, nigga

i seen it vividly joggin' my brain memory
life no, i seen it vividly joggin' my brain memory
life no longer infinity, this was the final callin'
no birds chirpin' or flyin'  no dogs barkin'
we all nervous and cryin'  movin' in caution
in disbeliefs our beliefs the reason for all this
the tallest building plummet, crackin' and crumblin'
the ground is shakin'  swallowin' young woman
with a baby, daisies and other flowers burnin' in destruction
the smell is disgustin'  the heat is unbearable
preachers touchin' on boys run for cover, the paranoid
rapists and murderers hurdle alleys
valleys and high places turn into dust, famous screamin' in agony
atheists for suicide, planes fallin' out the sky
trains jumpin' off the track, mothers yellin' he's alive
backpedalin' christians settlin' for forgiveness
evidence all around us, the town is covered in fishes
ocean water dried out, fire burnin' more tires out
tabernacle and city capital turned inside out
public bathroom, college classroom's been deserted
another trumpet has sounded off and everyone heard it
it's happenin' no more runnin' from world wars
it's happenin' no more discriminatin' the poor
it's happenin' no more bad bitches and real niggas
wishin' for green and gold, the last taste of allure
i swore i seen it vividly, a moniker of war 
from heaven that played the symphony, thunder like number four
then i heard what have you did for me i fell to my knees
pulled out my resume that dated back to june 17th
1987, my paperwork was like a receipt
i was valedictorian, i was fearful of judgment
but confident i had glory in all my past endeavors
close my eyes, pray to god that i live forever
dark skies, fire and brimstone, some of us sent home
some of us never did wrong but still went to hell
geez louise, i thought you said that i'd excel
i made to pimp a butterfly for you
told me to use my vocals to save mankind for you, say i didn't try for you
say i didn't ride for you, i tithed for you
i pushed the club to the side for you, who love you like i love you 
crucifix, tell me you can fix
anytime i need, i'ma start jottin' everything in my diary
never would you lie to me, always camaraderie
i can see our days been numbered
revelation greatest as we hearin' the last trumpet
all man, child, woman, life completely went in reverse
i guess i'm runnin' in place tryin' to make it to church

i'm sick and tired of bein' tired, can't pick a side, the gemini
prophesize if we livin'  i, promise momma not to feel no lie

that's what the indian said, i needed demand
tellin' me longevity's in the dirt, should buy some property first
should profit a better dollar with generational perks
equity at his best, really, you should invest
these tangible things expire, don't you expect
income with so much outcome and yes
look at my heritage, we blessed
now what the black man say a piece of pussy
that's what the black man said i needed to push me
to the limit to satisfy my hunger
we do it all for a woman from haircut to a wool, we like to live in the jungle
like to play in the peach, what you sayin' to me
he said nigga come back to reality for a week
pussy is power, fuck on a new bitch every night
i wouldn't be prouder, you should allow it
what the white man say a piece of mine's
that's what the white man wanted when i rhyme
tellin' me that he sellin' me just for  1099
if i go platinum from rappin'  i do the company fine
what if i compromise he said it don't even matter
you make a million or more, you living better than average
you losin' your core followin' gainin' it all
he put a price on my talent, i hit the bank and withdraw
hit the bank and withdraw, hit the bank and withdraw
put myself in the rocket ship and i shot for the stars
look at what you accomplished and what he said to the boy
i'ma make you some promises that you just can't ignore
your profession anonymous as an artist, if i don't target your market
if you ain't signin' your signature when i throw you my wallet
a lot of rappers are givin' their demo all in the toilet
you work toward your master's mortgage
i need a piece

they say the government mislead the youth, youth, youth, youth
tell 'em when you went to the park and everybody came back and
and welfare don't mean well for you, you, you, you
what about when you tried to do a side for that but you
they tell me that my bill's past due, due, due, due, uhh due due due due due
talk about the charge you got
and preacher man don't always tell the truth, truth, truth, truth
do you believe in god if you don't, it's cool

somebody said you, bumped your head and, bled the floor
jumped into a, pit of flames and, burned to coal
drowned inside the, lake outside, away you flow
and this i know

i got 100 on my dash, got 200 in my trunk
name in the grab bags, put my bible in the trunk
taaka vodka on the top of my binocular, i'm drunk
how can i can make them popular pop 'em when i want
see i'm livin' with anxiety, duckin' the sobriety
fuckin' up the system, i ain't fuckin' with society
justice ain't free, therefore justice ain't me
so i justify his name on obituary
why you wanna see a good man with a broken heart
once upon a time, i used to go to church and talk to god
now i'm thinkin' to myself, hollow tips is all i got
now i'm drinkin' by myself at the intersection parked
watched you when you walked inside your house, you threw your briefcase all on the couch
i plan on creepin' through your fuckin' door and blowin' out
every piece of your brain 'til your son jumped in your arms
cut on the engine then sped off in the rain, i'm gone

drove alone with a bottle of his own grippin' the handle

the other side has never mortified my mortal mind
the borderline between insanity is father time
i fall behind my skeleton, they tell me that i'm blind
i know that i'm intelligence, my confidence just died

i'm passin' lives on a daily, maybe i'm losin' faith
genocism and capitalism just made me hate
correctionals and these private prisons gave me a date
professional dream killers reason why i'm awake

these metamorphic supernatural forces dominate what i seeee
a gemini, duality personalities always conflict in meeee

oh but don't be scared of me girl i can explain
i know it's foreign to you, i know it's hard to believe
god give me the favor let me explain
more than a compliment, and i could use some assistance
let me show you how i can explain
oh, oh shando, i spin around two times
i'll be there with the answer let me explain

my momma told me that i was different the moment i was invented
estranged baby, no i'm not ashamed
i recommend every inch of your lunatic ways, praise the lord
you teach the kids how to be themself and plenty more
you know the male species can be redundant, i mean we
love a woman and think we can satisfy her between sheets
covers and pillows
i'm promisin' your lack of tolerance stuck on a zero
i'm promisin' that i'm acknowledgin' you as my hero cause you believe in me
no you're not easily impressed but i possess qualities that you need to see
look at my flaws, look at my flaws, look at my imperfections in awe
look how you think that my mystique is a round of applause
and yours equally valued
you stick out like an alien compared to those around you
and that's alright because i like it, you and me are the same
hopefully i'm invited, hopefully you don't change

because i know for sure who you are i can explain
your momma raised you, your daddy raised you
hand washin' your clothes on sunday let me explain
walking your brother to school
three miles away to feed him knowledge so i can explain
don't you explain that
don't you explain the reason why your mind, it travels let me explain
i wanna know what you think
i wanna pick your brain when i see you but don't you ever let me explain
oh, oh shando, i spin around two times
a blessing in disguise i can explain
i know for sure who you are
you're the goddess of the odd, i am yours i can explain
i am yours, i am yours, i am yours
i am yoooours, yoooours, yoooours

you niggas fear me like y'all fear god
you sound frantic, i hear panic in your voice
just know the mechanics of makin' your choice and writin' your bars
before you poke out your chest, loosen your bra
before you step out of line and dance with the star
i could never end a career if it never start
the murderous capital
avenues lookin' like evil dead zombies with batteries to the head
the flattery of watchin' my stock rise
the salary, the compensation tripled my cock size
i run through these stop signs with no brake fluid, just premium gas, do it for dolo
crash markets and prejudiced tags, look at my photo
black excellence, pessimist died countin' my coin
hope it's evident that i inspired a thousand emcees to do better
i blew cheddar
on youth centers, buildings and beamers and blue leather
forecasted my future, this is the future
the mastermind until my next album, more power to you

i could never put my plans to the side with you
i could never see a red light, like a deer with a headlight
i freeze up when i re-up
see i barely have patience, and you're relatin'
only the moment to complete us
why you hate to work for it
the reason i never went to work for it
see a nine to five was so jive turkey
but when thanksgiving came that check didnâ  t hurt me
you plead the fifth, i read the fifth amendment
we both criminals with bad intentions
they say time heals all
but if i can shortcut my success, corvettes by tomorrow
wait a minute now why you so sad

my home girl got a credit card scam
she got a scholarship to college but she don't give a damn
intuition, she got a broke bitch wishin'

oh the anticipation of hopin' you could make it
bitches don't prosper, chasin' education
but you're talented, and can't handle it
and your homegirls can't be your manager
365 times four, plus more
if ya can't get it right, tell me, do you got the stamina

a rapper chasin' stardom, how can i fast forward
my accolades better than all them

your projects ain't shit, i live in a hut bitch
i'm livin' to keep warm, you livin' to pay rent
i prayed my way through, by waitin' on allah
you played your way through, by livin' in sci-fi
bullshittin' yourself, you talkin' to strangers
same thing goes for the ones you came with
when y'all came on the boat lookin' for hope
and all you can say is that you're lookin' for dope
these days ain't no compromise
and your pain ain't mines half the time
a brand new excuse ain't shit to me
bitch i made my moves with shackled feet
cape town

so i was takin' a walk the other day
and i seen a woman, a blind woman, pacin' up and down the sidewalk
she seemed to be a bit frustrated
as if she had dropped somethin' and havin' a hard time findin' it
so after watchin' her struggle for a while
i decide to go over and lend a helping hand, you know 
hello, ma'am, can i be of any assistance

and excellent mean the extra work, and absentness what the fuck you heard
and pessimists never struck my nerve, and that's a riff, gonna plead this case
the reason my power's here on earth, salute the truth when the prophet say

to young african americans than racism in recent years

only lord knows, i've been goin' hammer
dodgin' paparazzi, freakin' through the cameras
eat at four daughters, brock wearin' sandals
yoga on a monday, stretchin' to nirvana
watchin' all the snakes, curvin' all the fakes
phone never on, i don't conversate

sex, money, murder, these are the breaks
these are the times, level number nine
look up in the sky, ten is on the way
sentence on the way, killings on the way

fill up the graves with fathers
fill up the babies with bullshit, internet blogs and pulpit, fill 'em with gossip
i feel like this gotta be the feelin' what 'pac was
the feelin' of an apocalypse happenin' but nothin' is awkward
the feelin' won't prosper, the feelin' is toxic
i feel like i'm boxin' demons, monsters
false prophets schemin'  sponsors, industry promises
niggas, bitches, honkies, crackers, compton
church, religion, token blacks, and bondage
lawsuit visits, subpoena served in concert
fuck your feelings, i mean this for imposters
i can feel it, the phoenix sure to watch us
i can feel it, the dream is more than process
i can put a regime that forms a loch ness
i can feel it, the scream that haunts our logic
i feel like say somethin'  i feel like take somethin'
i feel like skatin' off, i feel like waitin' for 'em
maybe it's too late for 'em
i feel like the whole world want me to pray for 'em

but who the fuck prayin' for me
ain't nobody prayin' for me
who prayin' for me
ain't nobody prayin'

i said i'm geeked and i'm fired up fired, fire
all i want tonight is just to get higher higher, higher
girl you look so good, it's to die for die for
ooh that pussy good, it's to die for on fire

it's a, secret society, all we ask is trust
all we ask is trust all we got is us
loyalty, loyalty, loyalty
loyalty, loyalty, loyalty

kung fu kenny now
my resume is real enough for two millenniums
a better way to make a wave, stop defendin' them
i meditate and moderate all of my wins again, i'm hangin' on the fence again
i'm always on your mind
i put my lyric and my lifeline on the line
and ain't no limit when i might shine, might grind
you rollin' with it at the right time, right now only for the dollar sign

i said i'm geeked and i'm fired up fired, fire
all i want tonight is just to get higher
all i want is, all i want is   loyalty, loyalty, loyalty
loyalty, loyalty, loyalty

10-4, no switchin' sides, feel somethin' wrong
you actin' shifty, you don't ride with me no more
i need   loyalty, loyalty, loyalty
loyalty, loyalty, loyalty

tell me who you loyal to
is it money is it fame is it weed is it drank
is it comin' down with the loud pipes and the rain
big chillin'  only for the power in your name
tell me who you loyal to
is it love for the streets when the lights get dark
is it unconditional when the 'rari don't start
tell me when your loyalty is comin' from the heart

is it anybody that you would lie for
anybody you would slide for
anybody you would die for

hell-raisin'  wheel-chasin'  new worldly possessions
flesh-makin'  spirit-breakin'  which one would you lessen
the better part, the human heart, you love 'em or dissect 'em
happiness or flashiness how do you serve the question
see in the perfect world, i would be perfect, world
i don't trust people enough beyond they surface, world
i don't love people enough to put my faith in men
i put my faith in these lyrics hopin' i make amend
i understand i ain't perfect, i probably won't come around
this time i might put you down, last time i ain't give a fuck, i still feel the same now
my feelings might go numb, you're dealin' with cold thumb
i'm willin' to give up a leg and arm and show empathy from
pity parties and functions and you and yours
a perfect world, you probably live another 24
i can't fake humble just cause your ass is insecure
i can't fake humble just cause your ass is insecure

maybe i wasn't theeere
maybe i wasn't theeere
maybe i wasn't theeere
maybe i wasn't theeere

now in a perfect world, i probably won't be insensitive
cold as december but never remember what winter did
i wouldn't blame you for mistakes i made or the bed i laid
seems like i point the finger just to make a point nowadays
smiles and cold stares, the temperature goes there
indigenous disposition, feel like we belong here
i know the walls, they can listen, i wish they could talk back
the hurt becomes repetition, the love almost lost that
sick venom in men and women overcome with pride
a perfect world is never perfect, only filled with lies
promises are broken and more resentment come alive
race barriers make inferior of you and i
see in a perfect world, i'll choose faith over riches
i'll choose work over bitches, i'll make schools out of prison

life's a bitch, pull them panties to the side now
nowâ  

when i was 27, i grew accustomed to more fear
accumulated ten times over throughout the years
my newfound life made all of me magnified
how many accolades do i need to block denial
the shock value of my success put bolts in me
all this money, is god playin' a joke on me
is it for the moment and will he see me as job
take it from me and leave me worse than i was before
at 27, my biggest fear was losin' it all
scared to spend money, had me sleepin' from hall to hall
scared to go back to section 8 with my momma stressin'
thirty shows a month and i still won't buy me no lexus
what is an advisor somebody that's holdin' my checks
just to fuck me over and put my finances in debt
i read a case about rihanna's accountant and wondered
how did the bad girl feel when she looked at them numbers
the type of shit'll make me flip out and just kill somethin'  drill somethin'
get ill and fill ratchets with a lil' somethin'
i practiced runnin' from fear, guess i had some good luck
at 27 years old, my biggest fear was bein' judged
how they look at me reflect on myself, my family, my city
what they say 'bout me reveal if my reputation would miss me
what they see from me would trickle down generations in time
what they hear from me would make 'em highlight my simplest lines
i'm talkin' fear, fear of losin' creativity
i'm talkin' fear, fear of missin' out on you and me
i'm talkin' fear, fear of losin' loyalty from pride
cause my dna won't let me involve in the light of god
i'm talkin' fear, fear that my humbleness is gone
i'm talkin' fear, fear that love ain't livin' here no more
i'm talkin' fear, fear that it's wickedness or weakness
fear, whatever it is, both is distinctive
fear, what happens on earth stays on earth
and i can't take these feelings with me so hopefully they disperse
within fourteen tracks, carried out over wax
searchin' for resolutions until somebody get back
fear, what happens on earth stays on earth
and i can't take these feelings with me so hopefully they disperse
within fourteen tracks, carried out over wax
wonderin' if i'm livin' through fear or livin' through rap
damn

this what god feel like
huh, he-yeah 
laughin' to the bank like ahhh-ha
huh, he-yeah
flex on swole like ahhh-ha
huh, he-yeah
you feel some type of way then, ahhh-ha
huh, he-yeah a-ha-ha, a-ha-ha

ever since a young man since a young man

shootin' up the charts, better run, man
y'all gotta see that i won, man
slick as el debarge with the finger waves, work it jt
handle bars like a fade, watch me work it jt
i'm at large, runnin' plays like a circuit jt

look look, hol' up
don't judge me, my, momma, caught me, with a, strap

slide on you like fallen drapes, god toss full of carnivals
i kill 'em with kindness, or i kill 'em with diamonds
or i put up like fifteen hundred, get yo' ass killed by the finest
everything in life is a gamble, nothin' in life i can't handle
seen it all, done it all, felt pain more  for the cause i done put blood on sword
everything i do is to embrace y'all, everything i write is a damn eight ball
everything i touch is a damn gold mine, everything i say is from an angel
i don't rush shit, fuck shit, always your shit, my shit
cannonballs to ignite shit, morning to the night shift
i'm on, i ain't sorry for it
ask for a piece of mine, you charged me for it
i wanna see sometimes if you ignore it
i'm in the streets sometimes and can't afford it
i got a bad habit   levitate, duckin' haters
oh my, my heart is rich, my heart is famous

this what god feel like

oh lamar
hail mary and marijuana, times is hard
pray with the hooligans, shadows all in the dark
fellowship with demons and relatives, i'm a star
life is one funny mu'fucka
a true comedian, you gotta love him, you gotta trust him
i might be buggin'  infomercials and no sleep
introverted by my thoughts, children listen, it gets deep
see once upon a time inside the nickerson garden projects
the object was to process and digest poverty's dialect
adaptation inevitable
gun violence, crack spot, federal policies raid buildings and drug professionals
anthony was the oldest of seven
well-respected calm and collected
laughin' and jokin' made life easier
hard times, momma on crack, a four-year-old tellin' his nanny he needed her
his family history pimpin' and bangin'
he was meant to be dangerous, clocked him a grip and start slangin'
fifteen scrapin' up his jeans with quarter pieces
even got some head from a smoker last weekend
dodgin' policemen, workin' for his big homie
small-time hustler, graduated to a brick on him
 10,000 dollars out of a project housin'  that's on the daily
seen his first mil' twenty years old, had a couple of babies
had a couple of shooters   caught a murder case
fingerprints on the gun they assumin' but witnesses couldn't prove it
that was back when he turned his back and they killed his cousin
he beat the case and went back to hustlin'
bird-shufflin'  anthony rang
the first in the projects with the two-tone mustang, that 50 thing
they say 5-0 came circlin' parkin' lots and parkin' spots
and hoppin' out while harrassin' the corner blocks
crooked cops told anthony he should kick it, he brushed them off
and walked back to the kentucky fried chicken, see at this chicken spot
there was a light-skinned nigga that talked a lot
with a curly top and a gap in his teeth, he worked the window
his name was ducky, he came from the streets, the robert taylor homes
southside projects, chiraq, the terror dome
drove to california with a woman on him and  500 dollars
they had a son hopin' that he'd see college
hustlin' on the side with a nine-to-five to freak it
cadillac seville, he'd ride his son around on weekends
three-piece special with his name on the shirt pocket
'cross the street from the projects, anthony planned to rob it
stuck up the place before back in '84
that's when affiliation was really eight gears of war
so many relatives, tellin' us, sellin' us, devilish, works, killin' us, crime
intelligent, felonious, prevalent, proposition, with 9's
ducky was well aware
they robbed the manager and shot a customer last year
he figured he'd get on these niggas' good sides  free chicken 
every time anthony posted in line, two extra biscuits
anthony liked him and then let him slide
they didn't kill him, in fact, it look like they're the last to survive
pay attention, that one decision changed both of they lives, one curse at a time
reverse the manifest and good karma and i'll tell you why
you take two strangers and put 'em in random predicaments
give 'em a soul so they can make their own choices and live with it
twenty years later, them same strangers you make 'em meet again
inside recordin' studios where they reapin' their benefits
then you start remindin' them about that chicken incident
whoever thought the greatest rapper would be from coincidence
because if anthony killed ducky, top dawg could be servin' life
while i grew up without a father and die in a gunfight



so i was takin' a walk the other day

wait

my heart don't skip a beat even when hard times bumps the needle
mass destruction and mass corruption
the souls of sufferin men, clutchin on deaf ears again

just in case my faith go, i live by my own law
i live by my own law, i live by my own
just in case my faith go, i live by my own law
i live by my own law, i live by my own

man, beyonce, i'm mad at you, man

i remember you were sixteen on the tv screen with wyclef
were you my type oh god yes, i was impressed
you was like 'no, no, no'  i was like twelve years old
hoping that one day i could chaperone while you're on the road
you wore braids with a banging body
looked like you did pilates, a lot of sit-ups probably
but bump that, i was there from the start
even when letoya luckett and that other doo-doo bucket broke your heart
hope you didn't cry, cause honestly they were just so-so
they couldn't sing anyway, you deserved to go solo
no disrespect to kelly and michelle, i'm just saying
they cool, but you you something like wonder woman
and i just want to hold your hand, bring you to compton
gonzales park, we can build castles in the sand
eating hot cheetos with pickle juice in it
put that napkin down, you know i'll lick your fingers when you're finished

i just bought the sasha fierce cd
i gazed at the cover for a whole five minutes till my girlfriend hit me
she's jealous of you b cause i don't love her like i love you
i even make her do the uh-oh, uh-oh, oh-no-no just like you do
she tell me i'm obsessed, i tell her we connect
like ice cube way before the mack 10 feud
she like, you goddamn fool, that girl's rich and you're broke
i said, so, i'm five-hundred mill' away, there's still hope
anyway, i had feelings way before you got paid
and i didn't laugh when you bust your ass on the stage
and i salute kanye for taking up for you
i would have stole the award just to prove that i love you
but jay shoulda did that, i thought he had your bizzack
what happened mr izzo hopico with frederico
he used to be my favorite till he abandoned my diva
now i tell everybody nas had killed him on 'ether'

i'ma sneak backstage at a mary j blige concert
with an 'i love mary' shirt, then find jay-z
and push him into a dancer, hopefully they lock lips
that's when i yell out, sounwave, hurry up, take the pic
put it on bossip the same night, yeah, that sound quite right
publicity like that yep, they'd be sure to fight
better yet i'ma steal his cell, then call up affion
he impersonates jay well, get beyonce on the line
then make up some bogus shit
like you don't the back of my knees right, so this marriage is over with
and the ring that's on my finger, guess what, i'm throwing it cling
you heard the sound, so you know i did
ha-hahhh, that should get him
i should break 'em up like a kit kat when i do that, yeah true that
i'ma put the plot in motion, that's for sure
but if i end up with macy gray, this plan never worked

yeeeea, man i hope jay don't be mad at me bout this song

everything is high stakes nowadays, that's how it played nowadays
it's like an 8-ball to the face nowadays, i'm laced nowadays
my gun is off the waist nowadays 
it's seven figures and retainer for the case nowadays
i'm talkin' higher power, every other hour since eddie bauer
since stash boxes and lead showers, breakin' the padlock 
and the dead coward dyin' a thousand deaths, entire lion
surround itself with bears, watch it nigga, you share a profit, ah

apple jacks and after that i hit the tv guide
animaniac the only thing that gave me peace of mind
i'm maniac when aiming at the enemy that lied
tell a story that i'll never glory twenty-five
not to worry, every warrior will come and see euphoria
that's a covenant i put on every tribe
ain't nobody gon' tie your shoe
nobody gon' abide by your rule
nobody holding your gun
how come your tongue say killer, then kill my mood
light speed living in the world you know
little old me, feeling like a live wire
bet i put some new tires on a lightning bolt
till i wreck into a pole poll like a right to vote
i am from the bottom of the jungle
living in the bottom of the food chain
when you get a new chain, nigga take it from you
a new name, want stripes, and you a zebra lookalike
hope another homicide don't numb you, and none do
things we will never learn soon
in the era where we wanna earn soon, that's an error
you can smell it in the air, and everybody really doomed
that's why i'm backdooring you muh'fuckers, all y'all can suck my dick
all them days at the county building, now i'm bout to make my momma rich
cartoons and cereal, i ain't felt this good since
scrooge mcduck, here we go, elementary hood shit

this shit make a nigga just wanna shit

everything dismounts, niggas gon' flip that car
aks for the whole hood
house lick went down perfect
two shots to the head, he deserved it
overheard it in my bed with a bowl and remote control
darkwing duck lost service
momma said i better duck, she's nervous
drama all up in the cut, hit the curtains
i mean, don't intervene with no gun machine
this block stay jerking, the feds stay lurking
emerging on everybody corner, dash for it
get a toe tag when you play tag with the task of a new task force
everybody wanna know my life, how did i make it past yours
well let me tell you like this, i've been running this shit since i asked for

she tell me kendrick, put it down like this
when i listen i want to close my eyes and feel your lips
let your lyrics wrap rap around me and grab my hips
so enticing, on point like the helmet of a viking
kicking up dust like i'm hiking
i ain't calling a woman a bitch on this one
i be calling my woman so i can get some
she fresh off work and lord knows it was hard
she take off her shirt and lord knows that i'm hard
composing myself, tryna remain content
she had a long day and plus i know she want to vent
now she can talk about her boss and i can give advice
or she can take the panties off and i can eat the pie
fuck that, option number deuce
on the kitchen table while i play this tune, you know why

look, we be in the car bumping my latest jam
i recorded at the studio around 10 pm
it's a club banger, catchy hooks and 808s
i even threw a bridge on it just to play it safe
the first eight bars she loving the track
even rewinding it back soon as the beat drop
the way she react, she like that's hot
till i start talking how many hoes i got
how many i've fucked, how many i've misled
just to get a nut like a squirrel in pursuit of lunch, uh
though i'm on some cliche rapper shit
i know she thinking all my lyrics, they're accurate
she so cool though
don't downplay it just to fuck up the mood yo
she will still play it even though i sound rude yo
and disregards to them provocative records, one thing that i do know

and this is for the homies
i'm talking bout the swap meets, rollie
chain-wearing niggas with the white tee
baby tell the truth, yeah you know we

somebody get ready to pass me the hit of that endo, i'm tryna get blown
i'm tryna get turned up like the fifteens in my cadillac brown, looking for et to phone home
tadow, the flavor i kick reminisce the good days
thinking back when we used to run in the swap meet for the rollie chains
pro club t-shirts, whiter than anglo-saxons
make it a 1x-tall, crispy with the cotton fashion
that's fashion if you come where i'm from
compton california, one love to the murder capital under the sun
young niggas running around the street with heat bigger than me
but i don't trip, i still dip like salsa to a chip
rolling down rosecrans to scoop up my man, a-mack
he talking about some foolishness on how we can pick up on some hoes, believe that
and so i scooped him round 3:30
telling me it's all good, tiger woods, now we looking for the birdy birdies
stopped at the sto' to get some rubbers
pulled up on the breezies, well what do you know i think they love us

as i continue my day, quite copacetic
headed to my momma's house to see what them greens are talking bout, hungry as hell
had the right grub, i bail, need some gas
arco station on avalon, a relative hit me up as he rolled past
we used to stand in line for jordans, excited we got 'em
rocking platinum fubu jeans with rubber bands tied to the bottom
throwback jerseys, chamberlain and james worthy was two of my favorites
i might pull out the green larry bird on special occasions
but anyway i'm steady coasting, smoking on that hiroshima
ashtray got a million roaches, i'm focussed but feeling good
the homies hanging on  and monte carlos
impalas and   shoot something nigga, break that fifty
i'm grabbing the city like i'm supposed to
making my presence presents felt like christmas day, what can i say
every vocal is spoken with the wisdom of a g
if you can't relate then please have a seat

so, wherever you located, won't you let it be known
and put on for the soil of which you was grown
i put on like brand new chuck taylors while giving you cuts
like fresh tapers, i'm such a fool with it, go nuts
you bullshitting like tuck, the bounce then untuck
the bounce then throw up, a rare jewel, you duck
take 'em to school i must, this for the cool in us
this ain't for you, so what

uh, a lil' compton nigga
just a lil' compton nigga, one time
for my niggas
you know compton, nigga
just a lil' compton nigga, uh, uh
kendrick lamar, uh
yo, uh

back with a vengeance
back with my heart and i'm venting
back with another war pendant, salute me or shoot me
i never wore a kufi, ignored my religion
i believe there's one god, there's one love
and i believe if i fly, we all doves
i make a way for my people to see the light
brighter than yellow bones, me and my microphone could be one
until i see big, 'pac, see pun, but this ain't eazy
i can't take a big l, my city needs me
i gotta win, the proof is in the pudding
and i've been fucking with cosby since i was ten, you damn right
any means necessary, get the campaign right
very emotional, i'm a gemini
i love hard and i fight harder, a born author
a born starter, in the game for real
and the games appeal to the struggling youth with no father
you can't learn if mistakes ain't made
you gotta pay homage in order to get paid
you gotta pay attention in order to pay dues
and you ain't getting it till you start paying jewels
lifestyles of the young and the broke
with my hand under oath, i recite these quotes
and if i ever lied then i'd die where i stand
as a pest, not a man, with a roach and a rat
in order to see the front, had to play the back
we played our position, we let y'all play yourself
y'all made your decision, we pray while we prey on competition
to flip another page of corinthians
i see stars when i write these sentences
words crash cars when i write these sentences
open jail bars for my niggas' life sentences
free j-dub, kill all witnesses
y'all better hope 2012 really real
cause the way i feel, i'ma make y'all suffer
and take y'all supper
i haven't ate in the last twenty-two summers and i'm twenty-two now
it's about to go down, so en garde, my god
we got these artists in awe
oh, i'm free
finally, i can say i'm me
the kendrick lamar ep a classic ep
the question concerned
i dropped it and gave the whole world my germs
hope y'all infected, hope y'all didn't have no protection
still i'm progressing, room for improvement
make room for the groom married to his music
i was at the xxl just trying to excel
networking, meanwhile my stomach turning
wanted to be a part of it, catering to my audience
j cole running late, if he don't show up
think i can take his place ladies start laughing
no pun intended, i ain't being sarcastic
homie popped up with about twenty bags and
fresh off the plane, i couldn't even complain
my nigga was on his hustle, i introduced him my name
said i'll see him on the bubble in the future
my dude i salute ya, contributing to real shit
talk about it, make the people talk about it, make the world see
for every emcee that i see tryna steal flow
tell 'em build a boat like noah
and take 'em to a place that i'm sure we all can blow up, boom
i ain't a star yet but i'm getting close to 'em
and if you see a wack artist, do more than boo him
throw him off the banister, shoot him on camera
then kill his manager, than hang a banner up
that reads you can't proceed without being conceived
by one album of the nineties
on rosecrans where you'll find me
and all my niggas is grimy, but i remain the good kid
tryna make a difference where i'm from, where you live
oh no, we've got to slow the city down
i told the homeboy pump his brakes
he said that he'd rather put the pump to his face
sawed off, torture
turn the saw off, scorching
hot where i'm from, the newscasters don't come
another ratchet got dumped, in the trash can
i ain't done, a baby in there with it
she said postpartum did it
molested at eleven and she always reminiscing
when he was undressing, said he'll only be a minute
that's why a nigga always kicking something with some feeling
i should have been a dentist, i should have been a blizzard, cold
flash, pose, flash, pose
a critic paparazzi got me on my toes
i wanna jump on 'em like a tadpole
tadpole, assholes
tryna kill my dreams, not elevate
those are not my dreams, i'll be straight
with a little bit of passion
and a drive like an aston
motivation from nipsey or glasses, jay rock
mykestro, bad lucc, u-n-i
dom kennedy, murs and fashawn
lady g, willie b, in time
i'ma blow like a motherfucker sniffing lines
go like i've never seen a red light shine
flow till my heart hit the flo' when i'm dying
heart of a lion, tell 'em get in line
and pass the baton, i won't pass it back
i ain't good at dimes
if the bitch bad i could pass you a dime
haters better duck like i'm passing a pine
know i'm the king and i'm passing you pawns
pad of the hill, that's a passion of mine
promise i shine
like two mics under heavy strobe lights
i'ma need to mics just to get my point across
i'ma get my joint across, country y'all gon' want me

one two, one two, one two sup, sup, sup
a-one two, one two, one two
one two turn the headphones up, ali
one two  you mix with dre, right 
turn the headphones up

when the whole world see you as pac reincarnated
that's enough pressure to live your whole life sedated
find the tallest building in vegas and jump off it
but i could never rewrite history in a coffin
so i'm talkin' to god, can you wash all these demons off me
this last year i've been quite similar to aaliyah
control my own destiny, only rapper that steered
a g5, g's give high-fives to me and say, kendrick, just persevere
the presence of being real
as i lay in this four corner room staring at candles
thinkin' how can i make an example
for this generation of compton my biggest fear is not feeling accomplished 
or turnin' back to that same accomplice
my past life was a child with no act right
tryin' to smile in a room of killers, turn into a crash site
influenced by niggas that spoke the gang culture fluent
assurin' that some blossom early and some truant
thank god for the album i idolized
it's dark and plus hell is hot, that's the start of this crazy ride
two young niggas, me and dave inside the garage
and thought we was jay and dame, that's the lane that we tried to drive
truthfully, i just started rappin' to get away
i never thought that your favorite rapper would want a verse
my nigga got hit 25 times with a k
make the decision, ride the beat or ride in a hearse
now punch is my mentor, top dawg is the coach
jay rock is my older brother, i was there when he wrote
his name on his record deal, we had figured the coast
would live on a pedestal, once the shit hit the store
found ourselves scramblin'  tryna figure it out
soul told me that the record shop 'bout to go in a drought
q ain't got a place to stay, and 'bout to sleep on the couch
we eatin' off each other tray, the dollar menu amount
meanwhile the coast goin' hard at each other
the younger rappers had wanted some of the ogs' comfort but i ain't need it
i never screamed out the new west, i didn't believe it
they brought each other down, i was plannin' out my achievements, hahahah
i need to separate myself to stand out, tahah
i need a better way to take your fans now, hahah
i need to kill you motherfuckers dead doo doo doo
three hollow tips aimed at your head, i'll be damned if the chopper jammed now doo doo doo
and we never asked for no hand out
in the midst of it all i recall a call when you said how
we could never resolve in the hall of fame
and i'm with the trial with a bible and a rifle, i play the game as i plan blow
hollaback at me, nigga
and if they said that i'm the one, why you askin' me, nigga
cause when the whole world see you as pac reincarnated
enough pressure to make you just open the book of david
and pray to god that ya make it or live your life in the matrix
cause fallin' off is a sickness, i heard that it's quite contagious
i need to separate myself to stand out, tahah
i need a better way to take your fans now, hahah
i need to kill you motherfuckers dead
three hollow tips aimed at your head

uh, whoever thought that rosenberg would mention me to dre
even vanessa from double xl had told him to press play
and there goes my fate, now i'm on stage with snoop
gave me the torch and i ran with it in high pursuit
rapped with my forefathers, even record with gaga too
lyricist of the year, fuck am i supposed to do rock

cool, cause niggas won't outdo us in the booth
even when my album leak, fans still buy it for proof
i came, i saw, i conquered
no shame, i blame all of this on compton
thinkin' about when sherane tried to set me up
cold game, full circle, they set up her
i put my life in these twelve songs, my fight in these twelve songs
the fight to ignite any wrong or right that i prolong
the story was short film, the glory of him and them
the worry of mothers that don't recover when babies killed
the trial and the tribulations, the newer miseducation
the view of a body wastin'  you knew somebody who ain't make it
the angry, the adolescent, the reason i ask this question
will you let hip-hop die on october 22nd

will you let hip-hop die on october 22nd

don't tell a lie on me
i won't tell the truth 'bout you
don't tell a lie on me
i won't tell the truth 'bout you

thirty millions later, my future favors
the legendary status of a hip-hop rhyme savior
travel 'round the atlas in this spaceship, candy-coated, my day shift's
been devoted to fuckin' up bundles of paper
pi equals three-fourteen
the devil's pie is big enough to justify the whole thing, wait up
lampin' in jamaica, the clouds turnin'  my thoughts turnin'
burnin' castor oil, i been determined to make an earnin'
this seed in this soil is classified

hoppin' out before the vehicle crash, i'm on a roll
yellin'  one, two, three, four, five

so damn great, motherfucker i've died
what you hearin' now is a paranormal vibe
house on the hill, house on the beach nigga facts
a condo in compton, i'm still in reach nigga facts
i'm fresh out the water, i'm 'bout to breach nigga
the five-foot giant woke up out of his sleep nigga
oh yeah, oh yeah, mo' cars, mo' lears, mo' bars, no peers

september 22nd, 2009
kendrick lamar, to to

let me start off this letter saying i don't like you
scared of you, but i will fight you
i stare at the ceiling and think about you
curiosity killing me, thinking of when i'ma meet you
you introduced yourself to so many others, mothers, sisters and brothers
children and babies, drive me crazy, i wonder
why you love people that love people that do right
is it rocket science to you, or is it just your type
one of my biggest fears
is waking up four in the morning and gotta hear you met one of my peers
or maybe a family member that you thought was cool
or maybe a person that i'll never meet cause of you
you, son of a bitch, and i wish you never existed
and i swear i'd blow your brains out if you paid me a visit
but that's not realistic, cause you'll never write
but i'ma still send this letter off, po box
and when you get it

let me continue this letter saying i don't like you
i'm scared of you, but i will fight you
should be ashamed of the moves you make
the pain you bring, the sorrow and the hearts you break
every day you remind me that you're always there
cause every time i come around, someone's getting shot down
and all i say is a prayer, so help me lord
then the lord talk back, i can't help you boy
that's fucked up, my luck's fucked, was cursed before birth
and what's fucked up, i gotta live my life with the hurt
of knowing that you're everlasting, dwelling upon the masses
of the earth, fatal assassins snatch your bodies
probably, on my notepad as i write
why the fuck you wanna take my life
sooner or later, i'm tired and weary and my gray hairs are not in my favor
so when i write on this paper, it's real talk, so

let me start off this letter saying i don't like you too
and the reason why we haven't met because i've been busy dude
but ever since grade school i watched your every move
you slipped up a few times
i gave you a pass, so don't say i ain't sympathetic
but you can bet it, your curiosity, i'ma dead it
everybody wanna know why i act this way
let's just say, i had a bad day
matter of fact everyday, gotta take it out on somebody
and you could probably find me wherever the wolves parade
i was born to be a killjoy, i'm a old brat
conceived by adam and eve, so who you mad at
not me, see me, i'm just doing my job
and you ducking me is mos def an odd
so why send this letter as if i never knew you
i'd rather knock on your door and just give it to you

i can tell you what it is, i can tell you what it isn't
no more k dot, my mother had named me kendrick
fuck a stage name, that's the name that i was given
the only thing that i can identify within this bidness
i'm just a good kid from compton that want to rap
weighing my options, pick up a bible or a strap
i never killed a man, never sold any crack
all i ever did was try to keep my city on the map
but this monkey on my back, y'all don't want me to win
i'm tryna follow dreams, you want me to follow trends
so just to get a dollar, will i sell my soul
i look the devil in the eye and tell him, hell no
they say anything worth having is worth the wait
well i want the world, tell me how long that takes
there's no time like now, i can cut my patience patients short
or give 'em some more gowns, i don't even want the crown
i just want a peace of mind, and nigga, when i get it
you won't get a piece of mine, won't you mind your own bidness
a rich nigga buy anything you sell him
a broke nigga believe anything that you tell him
well i'm a broke nigga
but still i wouldn't listen to you even if your hand was on a bible quote, nigga
pfttuh

see i was brought up different
whatever that my pops said, for sure i'd listen
you said you did dirt, but i can't dig it
it don't concern you if you wasn't born in it
oh-no-oh-oh
i swear we got to fast-forward

before time flies by
my new sound for '0-10 is, why lie
and if you ain't trying to win, then why try
now you can low-ball or give me high five
this is i nigga, look into my eye
nigga, i am kendrick lamar
nigga, my name is kendrick lamar
i said my name is kendrick lamar
i changed the name cause i was tired of being like y'all
now finally i'm ready to tell the world who i are, pfttuh

and that used to be a hell of a task
now i'm ahead of my class, so go ahead and harass
my character like it don't carry a
confidence that can marry a halle berry or angelina with no cash
i'm bout to cash in my thoughts
give you a compass, then tell you get lost
what i'm bout to accomplish is something that you can't fathom
once the 'eves' come, they quick to stare 'adam' at him
hoping i don't take they bitch, but i'm on some other shit
when i'm done, i'm tryna run the government
they are big dreams
transition from a rapper to a human being, you can't 'school' a dean
i be tutoring artist-es, leave 'em with no audience
all cause they all oversaw it, my god
y'all be out partying, i be stealing your audience
all because who i are, lamar

but my first name, it gotta be kendrick lamar
nigga, my name is kendrick lamar
i changed the name cause i was tired of being like y'all
now finally i'm ready to tell the world who i are, now let's go
but we can't go backwards

uh, yeah 
kendrick lamar, uh

yeah i can reconcile being depressed real bad
i'm a thinker, not a drinker, but still i hennessy drag
alcohol numbs the pain like when novocaine stabs
in your arteries, pardon me but my city go mad
via compton california, corners with coroners and karma on 'em
colors corresponding to gangs upon us
common corrupted crip and pirus cripple the city
triple the crime, bible nor the qur'an can save
welcome, don't be afraid, your city similar right
where the choppers kidnap the night and police silence your rights
stare at the sky, wonder will you live to see twenty-five
i'm twenty-two, at twenty i knew i was against the odds
this kid named jonathan was monitoring
his momma and sister, his older cousin, he honored him
anonymous bodies on his burner was astonishing
to johnny, he might have been a modern day rider then
he walking outside again, he see the lifestyle of an active member
pull out a mac-11, now his eyes is big
fascinated by mayhem, what's his cousin to say now
he wanna be from the hood that he's from and that's one
more gangster under the family tree, took 'em under his wings like kfc
crip crazy, rocking matching t-shirts that says the hood made me
no love, just spread slugs, that's the policy, the leader and the prodigy
now shorty doo-wop, holding a oowop, hanging with rah-rahs
with blah-blahs that sit on the block catching fades and licks
going on missions with lunatics, a ninth-grade menace
thugging for six months, smoking like six blunts an hour
the power of banging, he was walking from 
little johnny

i think you'll find, sir, that there will come a time
 when black people wake up and become intellectually independent enough to think for themselves
 as other humans are intellectually independent enough to think for themselves
 then the black man will think like a black man and he will feel for other black people
 and this new thinking and feeling will cause black people to stick together
 and then at that point you'll have a situation
 where when you attack one black man, you are attacking all black men
 and this type of black thinking will cause all black people to stick together
 and this type of thinking also will bring an end
 to the brutality inflicted upon black people by black people
 and it is the only thing that will bring an end to it
 no federal court, state court or city court will bring an end to it
 it's something that the black man has to bring an end to

wow, i think y'all must have forgot or something
like i ain't hot or something
like i don't make your girl take off her top or something

but, mm, jumped in the coupe and i'm gone
i smell like money, i don't need no cologne
i just need me a freak that can jump on the bone
like an x-ray technician, my rectangular prism
says money, sex, then drugs, all cause i'm twenty-one
like playing blackjack, picture this kodak
moment forever, k dot that dude
she sucked my dick and got frostbite, i'm that cool

yeeeaah, bottle of goose and i'm gone
watching her get loose like a third grader's tooth
the shit that we on is the ultimate high
'xxl' flow, that's the ultimate 'vibe'
park that lambi outside just to fuck with the haters
put the lambi in drive, watch it peel like potatoes
holler l-m-a-o with a drunken two-step
like i never could pass a sobriety test

yeeeah, i'm in the club acting mannish
cavalli lenses, make my view panoramic
i'm out of this world, i'm off of this planet
they don't say k dot is here, they say his spaceship has landed
and your access has been granted granite, like a kitchen floor
but my kitchen's marble, i ride in the carpool
because i got two whores in the back of that roam
see they're all i need, like a layup from a loan

uh, shoutout to schoolboy q
he uglier than a motherfucker

tire marks, tire marks, finish line with the tire marks
when the relay starts i'm a runaway slave, uhh
walking on water and running on waves, god mc
oh my god you gotta see, there's never no is in me
of an odyssey, i'm a block away
fire marshals moving in, marshmallows inside my pen
sweet sixteens, got a sweet sixteen and they deadlier than sin
i'm so appalled, with a prototype with a guy named protocol
you an amateur, they want a pro' to call
i'll damage on camera in compton, in canada, i don't care where ya are
just blink twice and i'm there where ya are
like a shadow in the dark, you a paddle in the boat
in an ocean full of sharks, bout to come up short
water in the pot, throw crack rock
like bam bam nigga, have two grams nigga
pay up or blam blam nigga, have the black cam'
we can go dipset, killa cam nigga
i've been around niggas, killers, pimps
you ain't been around shit but your momma and your bitch
jumped off the porch when i was like six
uncle bobby got the house raided back in '9-6
kick in the do'
canines was all in the kitchen way before i even heard of mike vick
momma in the bathroom, poppa at work
happened on a sunday, we should have went to church
look at my shirt, polo on it
it's gon' sell if my logo on it
i fear no opponent
a demon come near and i might throw a spear at the omen
you looking at the twenty-ten romans' empire
hiiipower, hp, in ya face like hd
and i spit like an hk, i'ma shot like an h3
h-u-b-c-i-t-y, ab and yg
problem and hootie, nigga
tell the government come shoot me, nigga
cause i'm going out with a fist raised
and a fistful of money, give it to the fifth grade
drink a fifth of hennessy and then take another fade
with a democratic politician from ca
they don't wanna see a b-l-a-c-k
making some scratch like a hall of fame dj
give us some free js, put us in the pjs
now we in the county jail calling for a three-way
goddamn, your call
marketing base, where your goddamn barcode
stuck in the street, was dark like harpo
black man, tell me where your goddamn heart go
although i'm in the land of milk and honey
nobody never gave me shit
when i got my first chain all them niggas tried to take it from me
i had to fight back and shit, get it back and shit
and you rap niggas looking funny
tryna talk back and shit, like he back that shit
acting like you real or something
nigga ain't popped no steel, ain't popped no collar
go pop some pills or something
you trying real hard to appeal to someone
i'm being myself, my b-f-f is a b-m-w
with your b-m in it and a stash box glove
and the medicine the doctor gave a nigga won't help
i'm at a limit where i be amazing myself
i bet i finish on a level with a black belt
i'm better anywhere, every rapper get killed
like bla-bla-bla-bla where the knife at
cut-cut-cut where your life at
career's over, he's slumped over
and if i'm off beat, know i'm un-sober
that's a new flow

plus-plus q gave me some kush and some nuvo
new dough for the new year
and i sumo on a rap peer
not a rapper, i'm a raptor
that's a t-rex in a v-neck for the rapture
i'm a factor in your facial
i'm a fracture to a fraction
of one half, and i hate math
pastor's like eddie long, fucking maricone
took me mighty long to get here, nigga, fuck

told ya i was gonna fall off q
we recording you got that shit
yeah, yeah ugly, our ugly ass 
fuck all that, setbacks dropping december
don't woooorry

look inside the highs of the last mohicans survived
you won't last a weekend outside
seen a pastor tweakin, then sunk his teeth in a rock his demise
later on that evening you heard the grieving of angels that cried
see a demon don't compromise
and so i walk alone with a cross and a diamond stone
i'm a diamond inside the rough that's too mighty for maricons
i might as well put all my killers in ysl
put my voice on this microphone, put you pussy niggaz through hell
hell's fire, i never lie, you'll never grind
i know the priors they runnin by us when we do crime
i know that section eight wanna discontinue my moms
when they heard that ohio state gave me 30 racks in july
oh lord, this can't be life, no it can't be life
when the day breaks and you earned them stripes and you learned that strike
from upstate will adjourn that life and confirm that life
it's good bait for the warden that might get awarded and write
down your fate you record it that night, a reporter replied
the death rate will eventually climb, so eventually i'm
on a track race for the dough before time get a clock that resigns
so about face if it ain't business, i get offended, i mind
no one fake, i'm a realest in strive, of a bilion in five
well a billion cause the limit is the sky, and i live on cloud nine
and i recognize my nemesis gon' try but i'm finishin my shine
but pussy where it hurt you, life in the power circle

they say pressure bust pipes
and i ain't never had to deal with plumbing in my life, now that's a bar
sparring with me like blasphemy to cathedral
or colliding with the diesel with your baby in your arms
you would test me but you know better
it's inadequate to go against the jesus of nazareth
of the rap game, and guess what, i got no cheddar
but my mind is like a wizard
i define the laws of gravity every time i get high and write a sentence
back teeth never been in agony, but i got wisdom
i have risen from the wicked to jump on the competition, scorch ya
third degree burns next to their sideburns, all sorts of
combustable flows, firemen on speed dial
free the leaders of the free world with a freestyle
free the teachers, black activists get up off your feet now
and feed off my feelings as i control my wheel
like new power steering, so sincere
tryna duck court hearings but i got big ears
rap peers, used to study them wishing they would fuck with me
now they can't fuck with him, i'm wishing good luck to them
reluctantly these critics loving me and i don't blame 'em
they say, kendrick you gunning for these niggas
so when i pull my weapon out, i give 'em the pleasure to see me aim it
and watch these bullets run into these niggas, clear the set
i got now, i got next, give you nouns, give you verbs
give you adjectives while proposing an agitated threat
i am most debated in barber shops all because they slept on me
big homie fear young, buck cause when i buck i make more than a buck
dollars come quick like a fucking nun fucking for the first time
put me in alaska for six months in the dark, in my heart i know sun son still shine
still got a skill to be found in a gold mine

too many relays for djs to replay
i do the reject while i eject your new singlay
hot enough to sit in hell, then unveil in heatwave
piss on a demon with ice water
and if i lose my voice then i'm probably calling out to all pa
systems to assist in with the word i'm tryna spread
like county jail bread or the legs of a hoochie
and that's off top like a toupee, i'm 2pac
coming back for doomsday, spitting at cops, go and cop my album
get high to it, pop some valium, then turn up the volume
i influence ghettos where it says caution
and them larkins get to sparking like la females that's balling
round the time this happens often, the violence get the flare
we racing against life, the turtle or the hare
and nobody can compare to the legacy that we bout to build
y'all work at build-a-bear's office, underhand pitching with skills

nigga, nothing but the best
every time we hit your tape deck niggas hit the deck
i rhyme like a fucking tec
-9, and i 'clown posses' if they disrespect
you looking at t-rex snapping at 'em with tourette's
yeah, this the flow that killed aspiring rappers
too late, i grab the eight and start expiring rappers
some shit only big and pac could rap after
and if they was alive, they would have to pay tithes
i am god
mcr squares will disperse in despair, this is me motherfucker

rare breed, kendrick lamar
breed up or speed up
breed up or speed up
breed up or speed up

this is for my niggas that be all blacked out
hit the streets a hundred deep, what rare breed about
riding hard, bending corners, the girlies on us
leave a hater scarred, big dressers sit at the stop light
road glides and road kings deep in my hindsight
you do it right or don't do it at all
put that candy paint on it, ride them twenty-threes homie
custom seats, custom brakes, hit the streets and ball
centre of attention like bynum and gasol, aw
you know that killer californication
when you feeling like you sitting on a ceiling, chasing
dreams, hoping this conglomerate can run the nation
it's abomination how we bomb yo' block
i'm talking big punch, k-dub, baby slip billy
bad azz, rare breed, we all we got
see 'em out, show 'em love, chunk the deuce, give it up
it's a lot of bike clubs but they not this hard, nope

and it's like that to the death though
two-oh-point and seeing decimals, i ain't lying
pounding on the interstate in the state that shines
or we might be in a hood near you
around the globe baby, rare breed under control baby
them pipes loud, the movement entice crowds
we heat it up in the cold baby
it's three degrees out then you should see me out
or see bout them kitty cats and how they go meow
ha-ha, we be the father of harley drivers, so don't bother
show you infants how to whip it, have a bye-bye
posers try to hang then we hang 'em by the collar
silk, lannie, rare breed family
stunting hard like a black circus, voila
breed up or speed up, get ahead
so with that said, bye-bye

shouting out the one and only rare breed
now breed up

reporting live, compton california
the good kid

i'm tired of doing it
the same way, gotta flip it before i ruin it
make it all make sense 'fore you put your two in it
opinions get thrown out the window with ron browz
so turn me up loud so the world can hear
and when your favorite rapper rapping you should cover your ears
and go death, go death i said
go death and stay dead, a shot to the forehead to kill 'em
but i ain't here for no ignorance
i'm militant as martin luther king and a penalty
aiming for my dreams till a bullet bounce off
one of my deep thoughts and hit a nigga in the spleen
i've got in it my genes, you probably think i'm talking bout a pistol
but i'm talking bout the blood of a warrior
my nigga, what you worry for i ain't tryna jock your swag
i'm tryna better my craft and stay relevant, yeah

i'd rather you call me that
than a typical artist you call wack
on a youtube blog holding ars and stacks
of ones, but never could be the one
to rally communities or lead a crowd of blacks
passion is too strong, i'm pissed off
so there's a chance you get pissed on, r kelly was in the wrong
but that don't make you an exempt
that don't make you a no-go from hitting the fence
you ain't a blood and damn sure you ain't a crip
the crowd yell hoe but i ain't a pimp
i'm me, i'm free as a five-finger discount
see you on the flip side right after i dismount
if i ever feel like i ain't pushing myself
i'll find a cliff, then push myself off the edge
like a barber at the tip of your head
that's how i settle it, life or death if i ain't relevant, nigga

so feel free to not mind me
if you're used to boosters, drug dealers and shooters on wax
cause most of y'all niggas fabricate facts anyway
i could easily cheat and let the four-four play like a two-on-two orgy
but i've been there and it bores me
got to the point where it did nothing for me
at forty i want to afford not to record bullshit in my story
and i'm mad young, so i'd rather do it now before my career's done
this is pain plus glory, victory is here
if i cried, you could see strength and pride in my tears
i do it for the kids
i do it for the twenty-three hour lockdowns doing time in the pen
and my pen is the only thing i got for hip hop to change the game
and they'll remember my name as the relevant

and i'm born with my dick in the earth, you can tell me how much am i worth
i'ma die with my heart on my sleeve, many die on their hands and their knees
and i'm taking whatever i need, and i'm raping the government fees
and you're wasting your time, and i'm speaking my mind on whatever i think
and i think that i'm richard pryor with priors of thirty-two fiends
and that means that i here fly higher, tell me why are you staring at me
matter of fact man, your eyes is wired, you inspired by kendrick the king
maybe it's cause i'm living my dream, man i sing what i'm living about
in the words that come out of my mouth, they requires a random routine
of being organic granite, then my access is granted
to represent the shit that i conceive, and i guarantee that i'ma bring
my mind, body and soul, and i sold all these records off being myself
and i wish you can do the same thing, man it's easier than a stripper
or tying a baby shoestring, you stringing along
and really, why you writing a song your passion for music is never in sync
no secret societies guided me to the world of unseen
and they tell me life is a bitch, who gives a shit you can believe

and i see that you envy of me, enemy ghosts don't prosper
better yet, they do die eventually, if i'm at the event you will leave
cause you know and i know that i go ham even if muslims is seen
in my rearview i'm near you, but i don't hear you, can you hear this breathe
with an oxygen mask, and the masses keep saying i'm speaking for them
and if you can imagine my madness, then you can see where i've been
and the places the louis has been, and i swear i've been doing this when
you was in pajamas watching b-b-barney and-and friends
and you couldn't harm me even with ten weapons of your choice riding in
army tanks, you shot blanks and i shot back, made your duplex bend
what the fuck you think if i don't think then i'm right back where the city sin
what the fuck you drink thinking i can't write these raps in the lions' den
when i hear that you lying then, it's murder she wrote, ain't no hope
you go downhill man, where's your slope get thrown downhill tied to a rope
tell the world to put intervals, man i swear this the antidote
and they tell me that life is a bitch, who gives a shit when you know that

and i see that you envy of me
don't prosper, better yet, they do die eventually
cause you know and i know that i go ham even if muslims is seen
in my rearview i'm near you
hi hoe, bye hoe

twisted up in cold heat
but courtesy of the homie whoo kid, chronic features
hennessy by the two-litre, fuck a fifth
today i'm feeling like a nigga that worry don't exist
i need some alone time, cut off my phone, get in the zone
within my own mind, i'm gone, be back in a minute
cruise till i hit the beach of venice, parlay
play the strip like an arcade while bumping some sade
'sweetest taboo'  my brain is a castle
built from the hands of god, oh god
i'm a free soul staring in the belly of an eagle
that's not a metaphor, that's just me hoe
they say i'm an activist rapper
i'm just a regular nigga, jigga and pac playing john madden
now picture that while i finish rolling this bubba kush
reading scriptures from the good book
that's not considered a sin is it

what i compose be so potent
that if the earth dried, i could spit back the ocean
then hop on a jet ski and start west coasting
i'm not boasting or bragging
not a person, i'm a dragon taking action in the heat of the night
so if the devil came, tell him that i'll be alright
i'm so high off life that i can od
walk outside, then sniff a whole ki'
old lady, don't call the police, it's just lil' kendrick
walking with his heart on his 'pendix, don't be afraid to speak
so to speak, you niggas not within arm-reach
y'all midget mac swinging on shaq, now have a seat
you can never coexist with my mama's oldest, recognise my name
i got my mind right, my niggas locked in the pen
that's why my mind write ink over my brain, what's up

so let me start off the third verse
bigging up y'all favorites as i curse
fuck the system, fuck the truth, fuck religion
fuck the government, fuck the law, fuck the prisons
fuck george bush, fuck rappers who love dissing
fuck you because you don't see my vision
i fucked your new girlfriend too because she's cute
and the ass looked like a grenade within the denim
fuck the groupies, fuck the gossiping bitches
fuck niggas who can't fight, so pull triggers
fuck the new broke ass price, the cost of living
fuck your love, fuck your hate, fuck your snitching
and whether you fuck with me or not
i don't give a fuck, you can keep your props
fuck keeping it real, i'ma keep it k dot
this is me every day, jay-z didn't lie, fucker

bumping some sade
rolling my window down, then hitting the highway
no it's not friday, but it's my day
and sometimes shit gotta go my way
niggas got me fucked up, thinking that my music don't 'stick' like some nunchucks
top dawg, and we 'all stars' like we run chucks
but never mind that
take a trip to outer space, show you where my mind at
you know where my grind at
inside of the studio, that's where i spend my time at
fuck over the game till i make that bitch climax
miss me with that bullshit
haters die young, you can run to the pulpit
pulling off to pitstop, car like a flip-flop
bitches clap at me like they want to make my piss hot
i don't even trip though, i don't need no company
me i'm thinking long-term, tryna build a company
kendrick the good kid

nigga, what i compose be so potent
that if the earth dried, i could spit back the ocean
then hop on a jet ski and start west coasting
i'm not boasting or bragging
not a person, i'm a dragon taking action in the heat of the night
so if the devil came, tell him that i'll be alright
i'm so high off life that i can od
walk outside, then sniff a whole ki'
old lady, don't call the police, it's just an 'average joe'
walking with his heart on his 'pendix, don't be afraid to speak
so to speak, you niggas not within arm-reach
y'all midget mac swinging on shaq, now have a seat
you can never coexist with my mama's oldest, kendrick be thy name
i got my mind right, my nigga locked in the pen

kendrick every day, jay-z didn't lie, fucker

look inside my eyes and tell me you see a warrior
i never felt the feeling of euphoria
pain forever, prolonged
the pros and cons of prosperity is strong
wake up in the morning and i gotta win
not taking the victory is my only sin
and so i send a message to your messenger
a warning shot to let 'em know i'm serious
i'm ready for a war, when i roar it can break a glass window
the only thing for sure's the perfect way to bend you
on your back, even if i gotta slither through the cracks
i can crack every code you deliver, i attack
every hole where the bomb squad sit it on a tripod
even if he try hard, he can still die hard
run but you can't hide, white flags
you can pull 'em out fast and tell me your last goodbye

make sure your next move is slick, your best move is nothing
you know i take risk, darks clouds, i love it
cause i can hide in the mist, hop out and crushing
every soldier you're wit, so i'm six for six
i'm sick with determination, i terminate ya quick
i lead the pack, i follow no rules
i see the traps, i know you're close to
falling on your face, unload, reload
hand me another case, explode, explode
the fire in my eyes is waiting on your demise
i know you hope your help is close by

i swear you people don't know kendrick, you don't know him
but you say you want some more kendrick, i'm bout to show 'em
everything inside this human being, i'm still growing
i'm a premature, baby in this crazy life that we adore
doors on the lamborghini, i want 'em
can't afford 'em so i tell the swap meet to clone 'em
i guess i really am a vanity slave
i guess my ancestors turning in they graves
burning money when i get it, fuck a life savings
overdraft bank statements just to make a statement
when i put this fashion on, i'm a fashion junkie
picking cotton in the country, i bought this out the country
whips and chains, whips and chains, jacob know my name
he call me kunta, you my brother, we come from the same
modern world, that's your girl i see she rocking fendi
try this on, if it ain't upscale then you may offend me
copping everything in sight, ignoring they sacrifice
amnesia if i see the black visa in my hand tonight
i show my dick and then i swipe, that's a punchline
they was hot and i wore ice, that's ironic huh

word around town that i'm all about the bitches
word around town that i love my twenty-sixes
word around town that i gotta stay paid
lord please forgive me, i'm a vanity slave
it's the guc'  cock and shoot
 found my swag but lost my roof, burr burr
lord please forgive me, i'm a vanity slave
see my audemar tick as my audemar tock
lord please forgive me, i'm a vanity slave burr

aw man, videos got me wanting hoes
appetite for flashing lights, all i can do is pose
a black male, on melrose
i should get blackmailed, buy my people hell rose
niggas that ain't had shit for four-hundred years
overcompensate by over-accessorising with gear
many of y'all don't see my vision
i do it for the love of hip hop and the love of bitches
am i a hypocrite cause everyday i'm contradicting
i think of how i'm living, then i watch how i'm livin'
i know this can't be right, my conscience tell me to stay righteous
it's unlikely to see what i like and say i don't like it
biggest dilemma, my priorities ignoring me
i wanna move accordingly, but baby steps are premature remember
i'm flying to the south and i'll be gone till november
to see my family tree, but this a shame i'm yelling out timber

cold, oh so cold
how ironic he bought it, then sold his soul
is it masonic for your vice to take it's toll
the remote control is taking control
lift up the doors
that lamborghini i wanted come with a dumb-ass model that in vogues
i like 'em both, i'll wife 'em both
take these motherfucking jordans off, put on my loafs
cause nothing goes bad every time i wear gucci
i'm getting more ass every time i wear gucci
they tell me it's a fad every time i wear gucci
but should i give a fuck when it bring me more coochie
this a young nigga's pedigree, i pray the lord can better me
if not he bout to strike me down like this my third felony
them voices keep on telling me, kendrick don't forget about us
i burned my wardrobe, hoping that i could live without it

canei finch on the beat
turn the headphones up, ali
here we go

i woke up this morning with my dick on hard
didn't know why till i said fuck all y'all
or fuck this world, or i'ma fuck that girl
'good kid, maad city'  watch my day unfurl
i put my life in these sentences, fucking right
it's either that or life sentences, i'm relatives with benjamin
i used to give a fuck about my luck when i was innocent
now what the fuck is up i'm at your neck like a pendleton
nigga, i need that, bitch, i need that
twenty-four acres and a mule, best believe that
they say he got smoked, like where the weed at
and everything you hope, bitch nigga, we that
pockets on kelly price, back when it was '95
buy a strap and then we cock it back when it's uncircumcised
write a rap on how we just react when shotty hit the spine
give you dap, and then we slide through your hood three-dozen times
so what's good i'm looking for a pedicure, pink
pussy that pop, preferably the kind that don't stink
uhh, bomb ass head, uhh, till she can't blink
and her eyes get watery, you gotta pardon me

i'm so damn turnt, wheeling in a two-door
with two hoes that follow me, and you know
westside, right on time, tell them hoes kudos
eastside, right on time, they don't fuck with you though
when my hood getting to the money, the pedal never broke
came a long way from the ghetto though, but
westside, right on time, only thing for sure, uhh
eastside, right on time, gunning through your door, uhh

all praise go to the most high, uhh
all fades turn into a drive-by
part ways from the streets after fucking with police, guaranteed
last nigga did that died, don't you, don't you, don't you
wanna live where the ak go for only 8k
minus six racks, minus one on top of that melee
stomp him out, then drug him out like a date rape
daytonas bending every corner while they say

all i ever wanted was a dollar bill and hundreds
and my teacher as my woman, when she smiled i stick my tongue in
plus some cartoons and some cereal, snoop doggy on my stereo
some british knights or la gears with glowing lights, or perry ellis jacket
i would love a swap meet full of chevrolets in candy paint
that's wet with tammy on the bumper, can i hump her poppa tell me yes
a dpgc concert and a dj quik song on cassette
twenty years later, hi hater, i'm the fucking best

as my mind drifts and then split, like the middle of a spliff
i begin to catapult off the cliff
of the unknown, i've got a feeling in my funny bone
that we're not the same, just antonyms of another age
my soul flock with the carefree words of the wise
i spoke a hundred times like a gold d
ha-ha, l-m-f-a-o
i hate y'all but i spread love like mayo, then spread slugs
my brain matter is a brain fatter
see my vision or my vision will stare at ya
this is the future if i say so, you copping fitted caps
i'm bout to go and cop a halo, the god of rap
and i mean it, i play football with mars
and marbles with pluto and venus, witness the genius
i interact with the inner-city villains
that will enter your system like a computer hack, then give you dap

when the sun fall out the sky
all i have is me in the land of do or die
a freeway, a gas pedal, and a peace of mind
now that's the ultimate high
to the cloud i go, cloud i go
one time, baby tell me you need me
cloud i go, cloud i go
two time, baby tell me you love me

uh, cause i've been drinking too much, thinking too much
we ain't been keeping in touch
fell into lust, where is the love
my independency got tendencies of lack of trust
i look at the street corners as my new woman
seductive as she wanna be, hands all on my garments
and luckily, being in denial ain't the case
cause i know she's unfaithful, instead i'm grabbing her waist
and every part of her is tasteful, and i know your feelings hating
in fact, you think i'm ungrateful, i know
selfish as i wanna be, and every time you under me
i get the vibe you might need some time to grow

uh, cause i've been drinking too much, thinking too much
we ain't been keeping in touch
and every time that i think of your touch
adrenaline pump, give me that rush
i'm gone like a thief inside the wind
lord forgive me for my sins
i know she want me more, but i fiend for benjamins
she said i found the root of all evil and lost a friend
lost in the world of a young boy from compton
that never knew love because love was never promised, i know
selfish as i wanna be
and every time i'm under you, me too, need time to grow

tell me you love me
two time, baby tell me you love me

his eyes bloodshot red
i watched him as he took a fifth of henny to the head in memory of his brother
reminiscing on them playing sega with each other
he was hurting, i could see it, plenty tears, no kleenex
i stood by his side because that was my homie
gave him a hug, some of his brother blood got on me
clenching his fists on some angry shit
stood up, sat back down on the curb and asked me who they be hanging with
i wasn't sure so i gave him no answer
but i was sure that he had him a blammer and wanted war
revenge, what do say to a good friend
that just lost it and grabbing choppers out the closet
i tried my best to make him renege, but he was like my nig'
this feeling is more than personal
i stood down, he hopped in a four-door honda accord
before he bent the block he said k dot, you wouldn't understand

corners become monuments for the dead
candles on the pavement, postcard read
rest in peace, the yellow tape blocking off the streets
a baby momma yelling at the police
but you don't understand, you figure that we're just a bunch of niggas
but the picture is a story untold
see this wasn't in our plans
babies from the late eighties wasn't born crazy, we was raised that way
put that malcolm x book down, then raised that k
complete chaos when we off x pills and st ides
look the devil in the face from a saint eye
cast a 'spell' on you like akeelah and the bee
every killer in the street is a teen with a corrupted, mind
substance, time is no longer an issue
we don't have it, so pass the tissue
then close the casket, kiss the momma when you can
then tell her you understand, but you don't understand

he came back fifteen minutes later
he said, dot i went on one, do me this favor
dump these guns in a safe place, let nobody see you
this is critical as it gets my nigga, i need you
i said alright, so what happened seen a few niggas slipping
and i just started clapping, i didn't care who i was hitting
that's wild shit, but anyway, i got you
i love you my nigga, make sure you hit me up by tomorrow
i woke up the next morning with a cold
allergies got me sneezing and wiping my nose when it was leaking
checked the medicine cabinet, looking for some dayquil
but all i seem was some aspirins, just my luck
i got up, went to rite aid
hoping that the pharmacy department had the right aid, i bought it and left
walked to the parking lot, that's when i seen the faces of death
said they was looking for my man with a chopper in their hand
praying that it would jam, but you don't understand

it's like, it's a revolving door
that i've been a part of my whole life
fucked up right

mic check, ali
the mic don't sound right

even the shooters can get shot, get shot quick
even a shooter can get shot ali, get it right
even the shooters can get shot, get shot quick
even a shooter can get shot

uhh, tell 'em i got plenty arson to sell 'em
heat by the fleet, displaying it very seldom-
ly, i write till i ignite my cerebellum
close to the pen like i had three felons
come from a city where niggas show no remorse
and a corpse is just another homi' taking it's course
of course my dream was to play in the final four
till twelfth grade came and i was only five-four
so now i'm a graduate looking to get hired
my pops knew a security job, he inquired
but ignorance is bliss, that's what i was told
i stopped, dropped and rolled when somebody yelled fired
now there goes another black boy unemployed
with a lot of free time, which means he's vulnerable
to run into a lot of crime, i wrote it in my rhymes
and when i left the porch this is what i realised

even the shooters can get shot, get shot quick
even a shooter can get shot yeah, yeah, yeah
even the shooters can get shot, get shot quick
even a shooter can get shot yeah, yeah, yeah, so what's up
these streets ain't none to play with
 it could get outrageous
 got burners, 45s and gauges
 that could really get outrageous

so i'm thinking to myself, what's next
my security job only got me like two checks
my pops disappointed, told me i'm fucking up
irresponsible and i needed some growing up
i told him i would go back, knowing i wouldn't go back
working a nine-to-five is something i couldn't stomach
surrounded by the violence, all the goons and the goblins
with ninety-nine problems i still kept it one-hundred
these streets can be rather manipulating
especially when you're black and just turned eighteen
so what's a kid to do, when you're fresh out of school
and the negatives of the world constantly following you
not to mention a local henchman, compton sheriffs all like terrorists
osama with badges that talk arrogant
that boy fifteen fifteen and he holding a 45
thirty years apart, thirty years before he realised

uhh, soon as the beat drop
i bet some heat pop, on a block close to you
like a relative, you sipping belvedere
while these niggas planning to rob mr belvedere, yeah
i'm a good kid tryna stay righteous as martin luther
but it seems like all my friends eventually become shooters
and niggas banking on you is something that you'll get used to
you can either fight back or run home and grab your ruger
whatever you do, just make sure that you willing to do it
being too indecisive can get you killed inside your buick
cause you stopped at the light, five minutes from midnight
with no tinted windows, that nigga surely had shot through it
you tell me you listening, but you don't hear the music
call you billy hoyle when turmoil was near
this is the realest right here, when i lost my very first job
my pops said why, i said i couldn't aim for the sky
cause even shooters can get shot, get shot

i return before tables get turned
it's my turn, spur of the moment
they reproduce my sperm and try to clone it
stand firm, bumping the the firm 'phone tap'  i'm on it
i slaughter every opponent to bits of components, potent
you can't fuck with the horse power, you're woofing too much
you're bout to go hoarse coward as soon as i buss, pause
you put your hands on a broad, then telling me you can brawl
you thought you saw me when you saw 'saw'  frightening
more reckless than a paisa driving without license
hitting your new truck, then leaving you hiking
they said no, the industry let it go
i cracked the window, they hit the back door like trick dices
sticking and moving, and moving and sticking the prices
upping the ante before i'm an antique
i promise you'll hear me clear, even if you need three ears with tyson
gripping the panties, big booty, no whammies, they dyking
i'm liking them all, i'm sifting through panties, haters will spike it
voicing opinions, but holding laryngitis
but i don't hear 'em, i'm a winner by law
track 'em down like a subway when they sub-par
sub-zero every time i jump in the synagogue
send an angel, send a god, i don't make it look hard, i know
i just let the thoughts take its toll
more 'sentences' than level iv yard
bogard, go hard, black tar, concrete
tom vick, times papi mason, times three
uncle toms need toms to stomach atomic bombs, or die from my wizardry
rza, gza, method man, i'm a 'killa bee'
killer be killed, make your embassy yield
this is not your cup of tea, and oh
they say waters run deep
dive in bermuda triangles and you'll see us
we must, dust behind, emcee's duck
deduct, revenue decline when we touch-
down like a running back's grind, can you keep up
you keep a safe for keep-safe that ain't safe, bla

and i kicked it open, yellin' get the fuck down or i will shoot
i told you  not to mothafuckin' move
be another example
i'll take the whole industry hostage if i have to
i'll sabotage this game, a good kid yeah that's only in my mama's eyes
i seen a dead body at five and that shit made me traumatized
so these days, a little blood on my hands ain't nothin' compared
to hoppin' out a minivan, with a mini 22 3's and the homie tutu
and two more ygs   ohh nobody got time for that
these days it's only time for rap
so herbert anthony stevens
you make or break bread before we break even
before they broke our records we broke records and wrote pieces, of history
so these days, these accolades that's meant for we
it's only truth that this shit was meant to be
tde

haha, i know we said p&p baby
but now we on something new

uh, guess who's back in this motherfucker looking like a motherfucking chi-town pimp, alright

in a five star suite with a five star freak, slinging that dick while baby eat
on her punani, oooh mamis look at you bodies, i'm geeked
having a good time, put my pain in a motherfucking bottle
a chain and a diamond ring don't feel the same if a nigga ain't got his eyes closed eyes closed
i know you had a hard time baby, relax your mind
shit, soon as christ turned water into wine everything was fine

pac told me fuck the world, i'm 'bout to cum now
i've been a pro, but now i'm profound
propane on posers, restraining from the doja

or 2pacalypse i'm hub city's novelist
come and get your scholarship, i'm taking kids to school
a pool full of spit, dive in, i'm 'bout to drool

god is recordin' this, won't you look in the sky
tell him you got the behavior of your neighbor
even when stability's never in your favor

yesterday my nigga had told me his brother died
a day before that his homeless uncle was cold outside
a week before he seen the cancer in his mother's eyes
two weeks before that, couldn't pay his rent cause he lost his job
a month before that he lost the custody of his daughter
six months before that her mother said she won't see her father
and this before he did a year when them charges was brought up
i shook my head, turned around, then found a hundred dollars

i don't know why he keep blessing me
i don't know why he keep blessing me
i don't know why he keep blessing me
i don't know why he keep blessing me
i don't know why, i don't know why, i don't know why

yesterday i invaded privacy of a home
the day before that my partner had fronted me a zone
a week before i had loaded bullets inside that chrome
two weeks before that i shot them bullets and he was gone
a month before that i cursed my mother then slammed the door
six months before that i hit my woman, she hit the floor
i stormed out, then seen a black honda accord
them hollow tips missed me, then hit that little boy

so today i laid in my bed, stared at the ceiling
closed my eyes, then asked myself how i was feeling
i analyzed on how a saint can play the villain
is my life coincidental or just god willing
i came to grips, jumped up, looked out the window
seen my nigga had that same little boy that didn't know
bullets is nameless, i guess this was meant for
me to give him a hundred dollars then trash my pistol

now i know why he keep blessing me
now i know why he keep blessing me
now i know why he keep blessing me
now i know why he keep blessing me
now i know why, now i know why, now i know why
now i know why he keep blessing me
now i know why he keep blessing me
now i know why he keep blessing me
now i know why he keep blessing me
now i know why, now i know why

so i can bless you you, you, you, you
so i can bless you you, you, you, you
so i can bless you you, you, you, you
yeah, you you

as i watched the sky change colors
the rain flooded the neighborhoods of the black brothers
the black mothers are stressing, the coroners have covered
another statistic, episodes of a cold summer
the street runners got the same legs as michael johnson
the fast life surpassed life beyond the conscience
profanity in the air, the children use the content
the vanity's in the air, that louis bag haunted
that black girl with the hair that's kind of coarse
her baby daddy's in court, she smoking on a newport
seventeen with dreams of becoming a stripper
or becoming an aids victim while touching them zippers
the life that we living in, things we would do just to live again
how can an angel forever live in sin

look inside my eyes, you can see the universe fly
deep inside my pupils, the alien's camouflaged
another way to shoot you, my mind is of mass destruction
i drop a gallon of henny in the big dipper, then dive
bitches skinny dipping in my orbit
ever seen a martian gorgeous, or some ufo porsches
i live inside the air, plus i wear air jordans
so the mic mike is always near me whether swagging or recording
journey on my voyage, you know that sky is the limit
but it's ironic, that method never applied to kendrick
i catapult over your telescope, and when i'm finished
i grab the fire that's burning from mars to light an incense
this rapping's just a metaphor, and i deserve a medal for
writing another metaphor, about ambition
i envision me taking off, astronauting myself
fuck the world, i'll beat that bitch with the orion's belt
that's high

me and my bitch, took a little trip
down to the garden, took a little dip   oh no
apple juice fallin from her lips
took a little sip   boom
bitches, come and, go you know that
money, come and, go you know that
love, come and, go don't shit last
bitches, come and, go you know that
money, come and, go you know that
love, come and, go don't shit last

wake up wake up, woo i know only
trapped in the belly of the beast and it's hungry
if i can't lay up in the streets, i feel lonely
if i gotta break up with the streets, i feel lonely

justify the love of mine for life of crime, my life and times is hard at times
i fall at time like all the time and then i dream for baller time and then the clock rewind
and i   wake up i know homie
i know homie

we ain't chose this type of livin'  it's what we gotta do
part of niggas hear us crippin' and drop out of school
sellin' drugs or they pimpin' like some prostitutes
livin' in a nightmare, pinchin' is what you gotta do
wake up

they say i got the city on fire
i ain't boomin'  that's a goddamn lie
whoa, really doe, like really doe
really doe, like really doe

life is like an appetite of truth and dare, i double dare ya
life to end in vain before the end is near, see i can hear ya
cryin' silent sittin' in the dark, holdin' crosses 'cross your heart
sin is such a work of art, watch out for the love lost
bet a thousand, shoot a thousand, things a nigga do for thousands
made a million countin' sheep, gave it all to public housin'
takin' off to abu dhabi, beamin' up the motor, scotty
talkin' to promoters, scotty, everybody know it's gotti
murder one, you've heard of them, the revenant, the all day madness
got it off the white but off the evidence, the blood on mattress
big power, big stages, my zoo cannot fit the cages
this booth is not used to fakin'  my crew just love confrontation
i chewed the face off the laces, i moved the weight from the waitress
i chef the pot that made poison, i cooked then kicked all the patients
my bitch is way beyond basic, that's, life insurance, car insurance
good, pussy insurance, ayy, look what we're endurin'
ayy, ridin' in foreigns, ayy, k-dot, four years
i got the same watch but it's the real watch and that bitch fire
speed racer waitin' outside, the roof on it like a tank top
countin' money, watchin' paint dry, when i'm done is when the rain stops, uhh

like the waters in the open sea
when tribulation come over you say yes hopefully
and yesterday you could probably say there's no hope for me
but today i'm overly dedicated
i'm posed to be testimony for broken hearts in the city
you're either crash landing or planning on flyin' with me
misery love standing behind his company,
well, vividly i could see that your feelings would like to dwell
on our past encounters, reaching over the counter
told me that it's appealing to pop a pill less or down now
i heard emotions burn deep
i heard when you fall out of love, the drop is steep
i heard when you see a dove that's what you try to be
got these burdens under my wings but i'm still free
cause i can make the decision to let it all go away
before i ever run astray, i looked you in the eye and say

let us move on, let us move on
for this is short and it will pass
let us move on, let us move on
for this is short, and it will pass

let us move on, let us move on
for this is short and it will pass
let us move on, let us move on
for this is short, and in the past
and in the past

talk about it, make 'em talk about it
life to me is currency, prosperity, i got it
and your life to me is lifeless like it's living on life support
i license everything in my wallet, lightest boy with the biggest heart
nigga play your part, or parallel park your ego next to me and violence
next to me is definitely no one, i'm one of one
and i must have won that from anybody who had it, or better yet forgot it
mack in the back of a 'lac with a mac in the back of a 'lac
with a latch on the back of the trunk
hit a punk in the back with a pump in the back till he's off balance
and i'm back in the front of the front of the future where you are mentioning talent
and i'm back in the back of the block where the cop wanna cop anybody's allowance
iraq on the block g, watch with a glock or whatever hand-cut, no cup, more guns, more guts
fuck boy, you fucked up twice, you fucked considering you drowning
die in a lake with a date with a catfish, backflip, headfirst, smiling
cry in the face of jesus, we just pray we keep on styling
on you bitches, tde, ymcmb bidness bitch

everything i touch may disintegrate into dust uh-huh
everything i trust may dishonor me in disgust come on
everything is everything, affidavits and wedding rings
out for blood on my higher horse, i report what it was
i don't wear crosses no more, yeshua's comin' back
i ain't scared of losses no more, i see life in that
i don't resonate with the concept of love and hate
cause your perspective is less effective and rather fake
the universe and the heavens work in my dna
kendrick said fuck mother earth, that's psa
the land of the wicked, the foundation of lucifer's spirit
walkin' zombies and spellcatchers, i pray for forgiveness
uncle bobby and paul june is lost again
the underworld and the fourth dimension my family's in
the big money, the fast cars, my life produced
the blocks i connected while re-buildin' this rubix cube
so what you look up to fame and fortune, bitches, porsches, sources with designer thing
brand endorsement joinin' forces with sorcerers signin' me
law enforcement, their forces tortures us with violent speed
fuck your boss's employment, my joy is to see all you bleed

crab and oyster with gorgeous abortions, i require thee
flesh and poison, the point is the reason you won't die in peace
open door for my boy now they eatin'  we say finally
i destroy and divorce what you eatin'  don't you hire me
tape recordin' my voices and tweak it, let's play hide and seek
war distortion and forfeit this evenin'  you should try at least

mothafucka i ball

lookin in the mirror i'm embarrassed
i'm feelin like a suicidal terrorist
we act like an infant whenever you are mentioned
mind over matter never worked for my nemesis
i'm in a matter of man arm wrestling
hands i was dealt when i said the music business
was all i needed, when i got it i was greeted by an alien 
that said last year that she slept with a canadian
that gave him an addiction that would keep him in mercedes benz
bright lights and rihanna has a lady friend
my vice is similar women, love when you're my type
and you're winnin from everything that your palm write
put her in the palms hotel
sin city, devil in a dress, platinum chanel
live the ambiance, all cause the audience one day said i would do it
so instead of a verse bein read 
i'ma go and get some head off the strength of my music
i tell a bad bitch yo' ass too fat, capitalize that
and your weave look good with the indian tracks
trackin device on your used 5 series
i don't call back, just blame it on your canadian
the same day we say we're in the area
cruisin in toronto, hit me on the cellular
thought he was gonna sell me a false word like the rappers i know
sat down with a few drinks, located where you can't see us
a white waitress on stand-by when we need her
a black maybach, 40 pulled up, jeep no doors
all that nigga was missin was aaliyah
felt like, the initiation
a reality livin in the matrix
we talked casually about the industry
and how the women be the taste-makers for the shit we makin
then he said that he was the same age as
myself and it didn't help cause it made me even more rude and impatient
so blame it on mr ovoxo
the reason why i'm breathin on the vanity i know
the reason why my best friend say she love more than life
but i live a double life and need to let her go
the reason why the highlight 
was when he said you belong to the people when you outside
so dig a shovel full of money, full of power, full of pussy, full of fame
and bury yourself alive, then i died

you look at my lifestyle, i'm livin my life now
i'm dealin with diligent benjamin, how come my attitude piped down
i'm fuckin with ice now

i tried to get her up out of my head, left my bags at the door
she screamed she loved me, like she never did before

and i told her
go where you wanna, go do what you wanna do, i don't care

i told that bitch   i'm a sucker for love, you a sucker for dick

pity the fool and pity the fool in me, i'ma live with the

i can see the darkness in me and it's quite amazing
life and death is no mystery and i wanna taste it
step inside of my mind and you'll find curiosity, animosity
high philosophy, hyper prophesied meditation
reminisce on my wonder years and i wonder here
sentiments of my words ain't been so sincere
the sentiment of my nerves that i just persevere
the big thought of fallin' off disappeared to my fate
they say that heaven's real
analyze my demise, i say i'm super anxious
recognize i deprive this fear and then embrace it
vandalizin' these walls only if they could talk
conversations won't contemplate to my dark thoughts
lookin' down on my soul now, tell me i'm in control now
tell me i can live long and i can live wrong and i can live right
and i can sing song and i can unite with you that i love
you that i like, look at my life and tell me i fight
this that final destination, this that find some information
this that find some inspiration, this that crack, the instillation
this that quantum jump and that fist pump and that bomb detonation
please don't bomb my nation, embalming fluid waiting
i got mind control when i'm here, you goin' hate me when i'm gone
ain't no blood pumpin' no fear, i got hope inside of my bones
this that life beyond your own life, this ain't physical for mankind
this that out-of-body experience, no coincidence you been died
bitch, you're dead

livin in a city where the skinny niggaz die
and the semi bullet fly but it turn me to a lion
tryin try-tryin, tryin, tryin, tryin, tryin

back when my driver's license, was babyfaced and triflin
i made my way through crisis
i made my tape and recorded portraits in front of sirens, i made you hate the vibrant

i live this life at a pace that anyone can go
know your place and dedicate your role to the faith that you'll die alone
trace your steps when i do step in the fire of broken bones
and i require my heart's desire and when i reap what i sew
i bought my momma a benz, my boobie a jag
a cut for my dogs, with a roof full of glass
but still i be feelin like none of my light never casts
out of that black cloud that's been watered down since my first chopper blast
but fuck that, i'm not worried mm, even when discouraged mm
skirt off makin them hurt off, should've hurt them in a hurry mm
dirt off all of my fingers, dirt him, all of 'em gone is buried mm
shirt off when precedure, resuscitation came early
i need you to keep quiet as a mouse
which is ironic cause rats is what i'm talkin 'bout
i'm hearin the sonics of gunfire, the whispers, the silent cries
even though we know it's eye for an eye

good kid, mad city, thirty niggas, thirty semi's
plenty blunts, plenty remy out the bottle till it's empty
full throttle, fast life, dale earnhardt sent me
hope i don't crash when i speed past, god forgive me
i can see my tribulations getting worse
conversations with my past demons, can i soul search
hoping i can find something so defiant i can put a rose on it
smelling death around the corner, don't you put your nose on it
wake up on cold mornings thinking bout my life in general
career criminal, picture that like a centrefold
only the best of sinners know
how it hurts when you looking to be a saint but the way that you think is pitiful
times is harder, where's your father
you never had one, he never did bother
and so your passion is a permanent author
telling stories from the streets, don't let it shorten your sleep
be strong

bury me alive, bury me with pride
bury me with berries, that forbidden fruit and cherry wine
thank you berry much, but tonight's my night and i'm barry bonds
swingin' for the fences, barbaric kendrick in idle time
everything in life's subject to change, change whip, change grind
change clothes, change opinions, right before i change my mind
i don't really know yah business, been in there since i was bendin' lego blocks
now you tell the world about me   dry snitch
tater tots on my shotgun, now i gotta pop one at the stars
sky's the limit, i gotta finish as the first rapper on mars
mark my word, i'mma make my mark, even when they start their martial law
even when these martians alienate, my mental state is still at heart
fuck, look in my eyes, tell me i died, tell me i tried, to compromise
tell me you love me, tell me that i, don't give a fuck and can barely decide
wishin' good luck on my enemies, all of my energy go to the almighty god
i could drown in a bottle of hennessy, fuck your amenities, i'm gettin' better with time
ahhh

suitcase full of merchandise, that's my new plan

the public house, the plastic couch of a section 8 tenant
the regal window is tinted, the air conditioner broke
but i'm cool enough to ensure you my ride is an eskimo, huh
and i peel off in the midst of getting my thrills off
and i thrive off energy from inner cities that we lost, huh
i'm putting the ghetto on top of my back
and i live in the back of the jungle, lions, tigers, bears, oh my
hear the siren, walk up   drive-by
shooters, looters, federal fed intruders
engines on back of scooters, the real can recognize real
and we need to know just who you are, you are in the presence of many presents
kendrick, the gift for the future, oh yeah i said it
thug life, good kid, mad city
mad respect, representing the hub right

i tell 'em all to hail king kendrick, resurrectin' my vengeance
been dissectin' your motormouth 'til i break down the engine
this ain't no warnin' shot, this a relevant henchman
see my opponent then  cease your existence
endin' our friendship, baby, i'd rather die alone
your diaphragm is dietary, what you eatin' on
capture your audience with these words, boy
the holy chapel, the tabernacle, the book of matthew and jesus starin' at you
take your turn, boy
see it's gon' take a whole lot of y'all to kill me
see it's gon' take a whole tribe of y'all to kill me, i never die
my pedigree apparently only to idolize
ahead of me is only my future and idle time
longevity, i gotta get used to makin' you mine
you tellin' me i only get used to livin' if fine
you can never live in my shoes, permanently paid from god

when the sun goes down, i scream loud, i'll sleep when i die
but i will never die, my legacy is alive

i'm ghetto, my kool-aid need mo' sugar
five star suite, you ain't know, sugar you ain't know, bitch
i'm chilling, bumping anita baker
caked up, they wonder why i don't need a baker
but really though, i just need a hater
so i ask 'em for they number when i see a hater
ask obama if i don't know about presidents
keep them dead motherfuckers resting in my money clip

as i reflect, i start realising i wanna
make a way one day for me and my momma, family and friends
this ain't the way my life bout to end
so i'm quick to grab on my pen and
give 'em something my people sure to feel
give 'em something that i know is all the way real

uh, as i'm hearing the first and second verse
i try to analyse the feeling that's felt in the song
i want to tell rock and q to go to church
but that's a hypocrite because i ain't been in so long
i stare at the world from a righteous point of view
and realise a crisis coming
novocain couldn't numb it, the pain is unbearable times two
let's rally a team, summon, and school the youth
how you feel about it

you can take, me out the hood
but you can't take the hood out me
and that's the way that it will forever be
and i can't help it, i'm gutter

break bread   or break fast
before i blast and break legs, ride past
and they scream out little johnny is dead

sometimes i wake up, up in the morning, make up
wrap this much make up off my bitch soon as she yawning
take up, hours upon days just to find power shit to say
but you won't hear it, even if your ears was pierced with
beats by dre, i mean
the sun is slowly falling
we all surely should die eventually
so whats your calling
oh, you left your phone behind,
identity, crisis breaks mirrors, vices steer us through wickedness
jesus christ is right near us and devil said you owe 10 
sold your soul
i know sold your soul and get hopeless
my focus stay ready opened or close in that float in the open
of oceans that coast the line on the margins i rhyme
or choking or soaking up game
i'm hoping you picked the second one
change the emotion of jealousy that your holding
you're telling me that your golden but really cubic zirconian
let me see
i break you down like a pound of fire whenever your tactics are mighty clever
but even if you're mayweather you

every day i try to escape, the realities of this world
so i tell a disc jockey press play, while i press up on a girl
in the midst of the smoke in the air, the reflection of lights that glare
she'll be out of control like a hydroplane in plain sight, i might have to stare
and that's power steering, a power trip you see in my appearance
a pile of hundreds, all on a prowl like vampires in a darkest dungeon
speakers bumping, drinks is pouring, we in the house, we paid the mortgage
tyrannosaurus, that's real big, pop my collar, pop that lid, uh

come to my section to my section, and down some of this liquor liquor
then tell me what it hit for hit for

i'm putting out good music in return to build a buzz
that's bigger than life itself, or some bubble kush plug
won't you look the mirror you see a pair of eyes that's quite similar to mines
and if you do that shit should scare ya
baby brother of compton tryna the accomplish the impossible
with obstacles at my daily grinding, ohh no
here come the critics, but not from the magazines, i mean
the blocks that be so-called mad at me, they're mean
as soon as success is in my favor
they'll try to break down my character, like i ain't from their heritage
quite frankly, it'll hurt my soul to hear a nigga that i know
talking bad and tryna play me
like we ain't had pellet gun fights, falling off of minibikes
in a buick bumping clipse with no ac, why would you shame me

baby, i wanna i wanna get you to understand
i love you and i love her too
but that may be too much for you to deal with
so i wrote a song about it, you wanna hear it

my life is mardi gras and she's the life of the party, y'all
it's like ring around the rosie, when i came around they chose me
and i make 'em feel famous, famous, famous, famous
winner's circle, the square don't fit
and i'm caught up in a triangle ship, now
livin life in a triangle ship, now now
and i'm caught up in a triangle ship, now
livin life in a triangle ship, now now
and i'm caught up in a triangle ship, now

pray to god i washed my hand, but i'll be damned

radio never play ours
this revolution ain't televised with prayer
jumpin' over borders

ain't no summers for our sons, ain't no dealings for our daughters
every prosecution hung, save the verdict for the lawyers
illuminate the corner
celebrate humanity and scream back at me in the morning
every field in mississippi, every street in california
know the devil is a liar, it's the time to be anointed, ahh
truckin' to a stream, disconnected to a dream
head bussin'  hittin' nothin'  even if i gotta bleed

i spent my whole life starin' at the stage
playin' sega, daddy smokin' sherm, mama playin' spades
catchin' vapors, grandma said i'd get some jordans for my grades
that's my baby, when she died my heart broke a hundred ways
i spent my whole life tryna make it, tryna chase it
the cycle of a black man divided, tryna break it
you take a loss, shit don't cry about it, just embrace it
minor setback for major comeback, that's my favorite
my nigga l said you do a song with nip, k dot he a better crip

how it still breathe, give me the cheese
i'm resuscitating the game, see me and cpr, my name

gun cocked, gun shot, head in a pine box
with a dozen roses, holeless with a gift card
gun cocked, gun shot, flowers on your momma's yard

you wanna see a dead body
instrumentals from my mama's christmas party
troubles, on my mind
i still smell crime  my little brother crying
smokers repeatedly buying my sega genesis
either that or my auntie was stealing it, hit the pipe and start feeling it
oh wee, cut me some slack, weed never did that
this was different, geez, louise please help me relax
quantum physics could never show you the world i was in
when i was ten, cack when nine ounces have got you ten
and nine times out of ten niggas don't pay attention
and when there's tension in the air nines come with extensions
my daddy dumped a quarter piece to a four and a half
took a l, started selling soap fiends bubble bath
broke his nails misusing his pinky to treat his nose
shirt buttoned open, taco meat land on his gold
i said daddy, one day i'mma get you right with 36 zips
1000 grams of cocaine then your name will be rich
now you can rock it up or sell it soft as leather interior
drop some ice cubes in it, deebo on perimeter
he said son, how come you think you be my connect
said pops, your ass is washed up with all due respect
he said well nigga, then show me how it all makes sense
go figure, mothafucker, every verse is a brick
your son dope, nigga

i was born in '87, my grand daddy a legend
now the same shit that y'all was smoking is my profession
let's get it

love is life and life is love, i like to love
every part of you the party life can never do enough
so many obstacles the possibilities are breaking up
can move in hospital with that extra patient you got me stuck
i'll play the prostitute if you've got the patience to pimp me
but you never put me on the strip, put it on then you strip
put it on your fingertips and i'll kiss it off
you better not kiss me goodbye, test my faith and kiss the cross
i'm trying to go there, take you slow there if it's alright
tell me that you care baby we could share a full life
truth and double dare that i do repair broken hearts
cupid shot me in the dark, stupid i didn't play my part
ask for your forgiveness, if it's worth it i can serve a purpose
if i'm st st stuttering because i'm nervous
tell me that you love me still
promise that i'm staying still
honesty is all i need
honestly, we can build

kendrick lamar, i'm bout to get my mop stick
niggas bump their gums, and their bitches be bumping my shit
i fry your optics, if you watching my style, watch it
tyrannosaurus reading a thesaurus, hold rappers hostage
catastrophic, it's 9-11 when i'm repping
skip college to fly first class, learn a lesson
straight brutal, roman numerals
number one eating ramen noodles, rhyming crucial under the sun
kudos to the most high, which is me
i probably make 'em plan their suicide, so usually
i ain't never been with the shit starting, but y'all done started some shit
i'm bout to drink some ex-lax then commence
to returning the favor to all of my neighbors and comrades

pussy probably holding daisy dukes and c-cups
i look inside this industry and i don't see much
i just see lunch, and your shit that's more bore like tourists
i'm laid back, got feet up, how cool is that
the twenty-ten kool g rap, whenever i rap
i got my arsenal stuck on my back, i'm ready for war
they tend to look for me when they fiend for afeni shakur
conversing, not hibernating, under the planet core
at thirteen i cancelled pg-13 and went for gore
that's what i pledge
it's profound that i'm underground touching 'mainstreams' like river beds

letâ  s talk about power
let's talk about yours and ours that paid the allowance
let's talk about hundred thousand kids ravinâ   and bouncin'
cravin' and drownin' in words the day i pronounced it
let's talk about power, let's talk about do'ers and don't'ers
the house i built when i was homeless and sleepin' in corners
sharin' coronas and black   milds, donuts in el caminos
talkin' loud, scrapin' and combin'  residue every mornin'
talk about legacy, let's talk about the life of celebrity
verses integrity, curse the first one that thirst for necessity
searchin' for equity verses the earth that birthed us indefinitely
verse the verse i wrote in jeopardy, surfin' the laws of the universe and destiny
church and a god is all that's ever been 'head of me, aw
let's talk about my power, the golden child was
granted to be on your cameras and store counters
he's bananas, competitive, we can dance
see the damage, no more for he peed his pants

debates about who's the prominent emcee of the millennium millennium
and it's all for the benjamins uh-huh and i'm all of y'all nemesis thatâ  s right

cupid himself, and i'm shootin' himself
and the paramedics won't come even if you scream for help
don't let love die, you regroovin' yourself

i remember when it all started
on alondra in that small apartment, burgundy carpet and sega cartridges
poppa flicking blunt ashes all on his garments
momma off of wine cooler, magic johnson playing jordan
i was only four, but it's like i heard it before
a house party cracking off of the music doctor record
and according to my awareness, i was more than coherent
a cold listener, marking that shit like a parrot
my cousins kicking up dust cripping, they flag, wear it
round they hand like a mitten, aiming, use it for leverage
shitting on compton sheriffs like fuck the police
woofers and gold rollies, every swap meet should know me
cause i copped every record that dropped
dropped a dub just to hear doc drop a jewel for the sake of hip hop
whoever thought the moment i seen you on bullis for cali' love
fifteen years later you'd be saving my life, what

said i'm a fuckin monster a massive attack'll haunt ya
i mastered the rap then fucked up the monitors
mastered that, after that i went for thermometers
popped 'em all as they popped in the jaw of tracy veronica
holla back they promised us, no pajamas insomnia
will attack, i attack like pirahna does
hit your block like a comet, blap
and you all know what time it is, 20-12 mark your calendars
calisthenics and silencers, exercisin that trigger strip
rock with us metallica, competition no talent
hum in the jungle what's wild enough
just might stumble upon a pack, of lions

if you don't do it for yourself, then please do it for your kids
my nigga won't you tell michelle i love your daughter, please don't let her grow up, life without her father

open up another chapter in the book and read again
story of a gun-clapper really tryna make a change

my turbo boosting, my jet pack cruising
get jet lag when i come back to these fucking humans
i can put planet earth in a canister
then continue my crater search with captain kirk
look at my verse, you seeing signs
you hearing signals deciphered from district 9
no fucking rapper cipher when meteors flying
the meters are flying, but i'm way faster
run away, bet i catch up, fire like striking matches
i'm higher with martians laughing in spaceships, it's starships crashing
hover above the masses, a massive attack when mixing
kendrick lamar with magic, pull rabbits from hats

a shooting star hanging over a new eclipse, hanging over a big dick
when my music flip, nigga i'm sky high, shit

lifestyles of a kid that never had shit
living off that bad shit, that shoot shit, that stab shit
rock a flag and don't give a fuck about us flag shit
george bush got some nerve, fuck a war, we tryna serve
motherfucking eight-balls till we live at the pool hall
and knock billiards out of business, ya bitch
that's my surroundings in compton, have common sense
smell death in the air round here, that's a common scent
you know the gunpowder
you when your homie barely blink he just done powder, only at seventeen
you know the common statistic inspired by hoop dreams
now hired by street schemes of getting blood money
i try my best to stay focussed and hope the city love me
pray it's not lust, cause if it is i'll be dead in a month
lord forbid, for the good kid, they took his life
she want her baby back like a cooked rib, but that's just life
where i'm from

if there's a shining star
hope my city's not too far
so we can live again
see, where i come from it's hard
hope all over we can start

niggas'll lose they mind for it, wine for it, dine for it pussy
spend time for it, see no colored line for it pussy
double back handicap and go blind for it pussy
pussy got endless prisoners, pussy always revengin' her
pussy is calculatin' and good pussy is rather dangerous
pussy can be so facetious, the heavyweight champ
pussy is so undefeated, let's amen to that
i mean, the pump fakes on the facebooks and the screw face when bae look
won't get you no pussy   i mean, the fake chains and the gold names
for insecure gon' reassure you not to get pussy you not to get
you overcompensate too much for the pussy
you like to throw all kinda shade for the pussy, see that's what pussy niggas do
i know the ways of a pussy, i see pussy lookin' at you
how many niggas get mistaken for clitoris in a day
how many sentiments you make before runnin' pussy away
how many times she gotta tell you that dick is disposable
but if she fuck a young nigga like me, it's over for you
solã na, middle fingers up, speak your truth

toleration for devastation got a hunger for sin
every nation abomination let the coroner in
crooked faces red and blue laces for the color of men
just embrace it and die alone song of revelation
reverends and cattles racing, devils and demons and deuteronomy
fumigate our economy 'lluminate broken dreams
and manifest all insanity, look around
sayonara tomorrow it's just blood on the ground

sox gang

i'm wearing black pumas, hair like kunte
kendrick lamar

'bout eight of them in the studio
and the all want me

fuck you niggas bruh

skeme whaddup

driving on a freeway full of darkness
it's just me and plus my heart is cold
as an project carpet
you be coughing up commode
full of shit see i was told
that only real niggas can harvest any future pot of gold
and look at you, i know you starving, see it's burning in your soul
and you look for me to console your emotions
i'm on the road and i'm joking with all my niggas
we laughing at you the feeling of victory is a gig
and i hope they catch you whenever you fall from the pedestal you was on
and don't get me wrong, you was in the zone of a lifetime
but the place you belong is the bottom
that's why i got a bullet for every ego or tuxedo
and some scenos, a combination that we know
uh, tight rope, but i notice they walk a thin line
from having the disabilities of death, dumb and blind
every time i recline, then remind myself
i would never die with pussy, less it was on my dick, pussy

in every inning, sure your career's ending
you niggas ain't winning, really you're short-winded
the bases is loaded, you ever notice
your spot in the game was took as i look at your team choking
sore losers never can play as a 
send shooters on your block skirting off on a scooter
i'm raising my stock with every hit record, look at my record
your status will drop as soon as they message me in a session
minor league coaches, we feed them bitches to vultures
you posing as a poser, we post your death on a poster
your highlight is getting closer to stardom, we never stalling
we starve 'em and tire mark 'em in the dust so you can watch 'em
in god trust, i'm probably tied up with a cheerleader
just your luck, you fucked around and let a queer lead ya
time's up, you play softer than damian
we aim it at you cranium, and leave fragments over the stadium, what

my turbulence put a burden on young herbs
once it's cracking, it's a chain reaction minus yung berg
i'm on the verge of excellence, kill 'em off with no evidence
take a shot at the exorcist, then x 'em out with these words
panoramic views be tumbling out of my mind
this ain't 1992, bullets tumbling out no nines
big aks like alicia keys abbreviated
and nowadays niggas stand behind 'em like clive davis
clyde drexler, before the hood got dribbled niggas right up on that stretcher
an understatement said that k lamar was under pressure
don't press your luck when i'm pressed for time
cause when the press get this verse, they sure to press rewind
the president's prayer can't save us in my cul-de-sac
there's codeine, crack and cognac, enough violence to keep the devil smiling
while we whyling on them corners with the ropes and rats
nigga build a trap house, hope his homie don't run his trap
see the feds and tap out, that's wrestler shit
don't rest your case as a gangster just cause you wrestled your bitch
we move in silence like the potato tip when we riding
and we ride rotten, two choppers found thirty sirens
you ain't been where i been, i know where i'm going, and life's a bitch
i know that she hoeing, i know that i'm sewing what i reap
and know that i'm flowing like water from sea or water from creek
and if i don't speak, i know you ain't growing
cause i'm a leader, respect it when you see him
accepted by your new bitch, your old bitch and your bm
y'all always on that bs, and ps i'm taking all things
i'm taking off first, this g6 is on its way, what's up

ahh

uh, uh, hey
remember when you tried to write me off uh-huh
remember when you thought i'd take a loss
don't you remember you thought that i would need ya
follow procedure, remember oh wait, you got amnesia
it was my season for battle wounds, battle scars, body bumped, bruised
stabbed in the back  brimstone, fire jumpin' through
still, all my life, i got money and power
and you gotta live with the bad blood now hahaha

band-aids don't fix bullet holes
you say sorry just for show
you live like that, you live with ghosts
you forgive, you forget but you never let it, go
band-aids don't fix bullet holes yeah
you say sorry just for show uh-huh
if you live like that, you live with ghosts mm
if you love like that blood runs coooold

i got, rottweiler in tube sock
pitbull, lock on your neck, kiss it and you'll die
boxer, you take mine's off then hallelujah
shando, count my blessings, spin around two times
freaky, freak like it's the 80s
fuckin' explicit, radio probably say we
should tone it, down with the clean version
dirty, but in public you're like teen virgin
i like it, make me realize my vices
enticin'  flower bombin' all on your privates
private, meetin' inside your bedroom
head in that maybach boomin'  thank god for leg room
it's a trophy in that pussy, i'ma cum in first place
i'ma cum in first place, cum in, cum in first place
i'm your d-o-double-g and i need more, pedigree
what it d-o puppy chow, i've been grown and so off the leash, hoe

uh huh, yeah, like kindergarteners, my vision's bothered
by vigilantes that harbor on street corners
try your hardest to harvest bundles of weed on ya, the starving'll speed on ya
stampede on ya, impede on your pockets, then pee on ya
dreams of us living lavish in fabrics of fine linens
spending established with women dining and laughing
but this environment got us violent, ready to crash in
to society, take this driver seat, hope you fastened
your seat belts twice, when i rolled them dice i crapped
so many times i can build casinos from scratch
too many daps you might receive from the things you achieve, relax
that's what my mental say, but my physical's been detached
i'm on some other shit, like fuck the government, i'm higher rankings
where's the mothership i made a covenant that i was changing
but my luck has been quite disgusting when reality tainted
where the fuck you been left him face down like he was planking
in a cold world where old girl and her homeboy got a motive
you can bench curl your tribulations, that sensation's insulting
got a wifey or a mistress nigga, which one you indulging
regardless of who you pick, know life's a bitch when you ain't focussed
nigga, i'm focussed

tell me that i'm famous
tell me that my name is
big as venus jupiter and then uranus
tell me that your anus got your head in it
i can smell the articles and know you're heinous
tell me that you love me, always thinkin' of me
unconditional, i'm hoping i'm your favourite
grab a fishing pole and throw me with the sharks
that's the feelin' i get when you're concentratin'
on this pen, on this pad
tell me you're willin' to diss on my craft
tell me the feelin' of pickin' apart this track
stop
puttin' my heart and my soul in these lines
tellin' me platinum and gold all the time
lookin' to bury, a deep hole for mine
drop
this is more than you, and this is more than you
and your entire building slanderin' and abusin'
what i call the realest comin' from a student
told myself to use a poem as an uzi
empty magazine, i seen a magazine
you seen my trigger finger, then i started shootin'
that was nicotine, i'm bout to smoke 'em all
and journalists involved should've known my music

music is my life, the reason why i write
like edgar allen poe on the beat, like a parasite
you thought a parachute made my flow just fall out the sky
then you fell apart into a body part no one would buy
nobody tried my limits cause they're afraid of heights
they ambition weak or gravity let 'em die
i let you live until a nigga compose a rhyme
then it's like a rhino in your ass every time
time and time again i treat my pen like the pen
bars harder than pelican bay and i been
serving a life sentence since the day i was ten
nine times out of ten, you only ten songs deep
before you leap into a pool of sharks then swim
that's an analogy on the way i do casualties
and i do this shit casually, before the first end
i'll be in the hall of fame with my picture framed friend

uh, you're like a needle in a haystack
uh, i wanna sit you where my face at
uh, lunch with a few mai-tais
uh, purple kisses on my tie
uh, life can leave a dick loved
uh, now you gettin this dick, love
uh, i'm lookin for you with a flashlight
i wanna feel what a real fat ass like
no injection, i learned my lesson
i walk it like i talk it, baby this pedestrian
runnin through your mind like jackie joyner
pussy like pop like do go get me a burner
got shot like do this can be detrimental
t-shirt and panties, that's your credential
you're cotton candy, i need a fistful
i'm often antsy, hope that convince you

uh, you're like a needle in a haystack

wait, hold up, is that you with them big ol' thighs after school
jay 305 had gave me high five when i said i'm in hot pursuit
you said i won't ride until kendrick drive a new monte carlo that cruise
and that shot my pride, i tried to improv but no freestyle'll ever do
you're lookin for the nigga with the tallest 'fetti
you're overlookin every nigga that ain't quite ready
to make it rain on you like about to break a levee   hold up that pussy petty
yeah yo' nails did, yo' hair did, yo' cell phone is selfish
it only got numbers that come with a hummer, her new primadonna i smelt it
tried to make you mine hoe, tried to make some time hoe
but i ain't got the time or the patience to stop and wait in line hoe
her dreams holds versace, she fall for armani
only deal with rich niggaz, fuck you and mitt romney
i'm grown now, i'm on my own now, i'm po-o-o-oppin
change my phone now, when i get home now i got o-o-o-options
fast forward, wait, is that you with them big ol' thighs after school
and yo' three kids and three baby daddies and car note that's overdue
i know

life at the bottom is devastating
you're hardly ever debated, the party is obligated
by suckers that wanna be you and never live in the matrix
and never ever related to struggle and dedication
your hustle is nominated, anonymous then you faded
the promises that a victory lap is surely awaited
they vomited everytime that a rapper's annihilated
just wish them happy belated   fuck you i made it, i'm on

god, let me right my wrongs, god, let me write this song
god in the middle with a mark
let me hit a pawn shop, momma said we need a loan
god, let me dedicate this to the 80  that ain't never coming home
god, let me know you exist
in a city where a hundred hollow-tips get thrown
i'm off that centennial
fuckin' at the party, nigga, at the party, we fade ten or more
my hood came thinkin' we yellin'  we in this bitch
then we yellin'  we in your bitch
or you tellin' all of us our dwellin' inside of 2pacolypse, thug life
and we off that whoopty-whoopty-whoop
and we in that hoopty with the two choppers
so we're guaranteed to shoot
lock us in the la county zoo
watch us eat a bear alive and, ooh this feels so good to keep it true
this feels so good, i'm keepin' you
hope i'm teachin' you all the lessons i learned
when i made that turn off the 110
watch that marijuana just burn
this shit just make you wanna just sin
see that staples center high yearnin' if the lakers get me a win
i'm gon' liquor shot in memory of pac, makaveli live again
bitch, i'm in la yeah, yeah, motherfucker

pop 'til it's vacant
pop 'til the wrist pop, pop 'til he shakin'
pop like four on the floor been in rotation, no allegation
popular demand, i understand my name is only for conversation
new york nigga be like deadass
la nigga be like on the dead homies
i was off the porch like fed-ex
211, got bread on me
k-dot twilight the zeitgeist
roll like fried rice and tempura shrimp, uh
temporary pimp, nah, don't remember them
just canary yellow gem, jumpin' out the fuckin' gym, uh
swang like new dana dane, i ride dirty, uh
paid like two damon wayans, retire early, uh
fade like shadows, the stallion, the cattle
a bitch's decision for you is narrow
collision, the money, and fame, the pharaoh
the physic, the chemist, the lame
collateral for kendrick whenever exchange
compatible for riches with more to gain
i said nigga yeah right, i don't fair fight but i bear fight
lookin' for my next roadkill for the headlight
hangin' on my last four kills for the highlights
my life, hiii life, high five, bye bye

it was more than soft porn for the k-man
she remember my sprinter, said i was in the grape van
umm, well cutie, i like your bougie booty
come erykah badu me, well, let's make a movie
hell, you know my repertoire is like a wrestler
i show you the ropes, connect the dots, a country girl that love hollywood
momma used to cook red beans and rice
now it's denny's, 4 in the morning, spoil your appetite
liquor pourin' and niggas swarmin' your section with erection
smoke in every direction, middle finger pedestrians
r&b singers and lesbians, rappers and managers
music and iphone cameras, this shit unanimous for you
it's damagin' for you, i think
that pussy should only be holdin' exclusive rights to me, i mean
he flew you in this motherfucker on first class
even went out his way so you could check in an extra bag
now you wanna divide the yam like it equate the math
that shit don't add up, you're makin' him mad as fuck
she said she came out here to find an a-list rapper
i said baby spin that round and say the alphabet backwards
you're dealin' with malpractice, don't kill a good nigga's confidence
just cause he a nerd and you don't know what a condom is
the head still good though, the head still good though
make me say nam myoho renge kyo
make a nigga say big words and act lyrical
make me get spiritual, make me believe in miracles
buddhist monks and cap'n crunch cereal
lord have mercy, thou will not hurt me
five buddies all herded up on a thursday
bottle service, head service, i came in first place
the opportunity, the proper top of breast and booty cheek
the pop community, i mean these bitches come with union fee
and i want two of these, movin' units through consumer streets
then my shoe released, she was kickin' in gratuity
and yeah g, i was all for it
she said k lamar, you kind of dumb to be a poet
i'ma put you on game for the lames that don't know they're a rookie
instagram is the best way to promote some pussy

living my life like i'm living right
in the midst of a fire pit, the gangbanging and violence
is the sweetest song, and i roam with the heart of a violin
don't violate my patience, i'm waiting, to kill a man
as i stare at the ceiling fan, as a fan of these wicked streets
if i gotta eat, i steal steel like a metal piece
i'm screaming out, fuck the police, i'm dealing my cards with jokers on 'em
you can disown him or stone him, i'm throwing them rocks back
with the fury of bullets, you couldn't live your life for the moment
when i'm foaming at the mouth and my sharpest of teeth showing
i'm in the back of a black buick, finna black out
like february, ain't that's how blacks do it, right
i cut off my ears before i hear your advice and vice versa
i'm screaming for help as loud as i can, but that's not working
i'm working them corners like blueprints, then caught an l on my first offence
the judge threw the book at me, then said this

i smoke this industry shit, to me it's one big ass lick
i walk inside of a buildin'  tell the a&r nigga strip
tell 'em i need all of my chips, my life been known section 8
i've been a welfare case, afdc pump fake
meanwhile i'm grindin' cause drug money ain't like rap money
four white kilo snow bunny, equal one whole show, dummy
i'm on this tour bus and i'm fucked up, i got a bad call, they killed braze
they killed chad my big homie pup
puppy eyes in my face, bro, and i've really been drinkin'
why the fuck i've really been smokin'
what the fuck, i'm the sober one
when i'm so stressed out i can't focus
hideout when i ride out, ski mask with the eyes out
speed past in the cut-lass-me and little ocho
and we young nigga hop out
2 tears in a bucket, i feel like fuck it
that's the price of fame, recognize my pain, that's all i know
all alone, but i'm out here though
call my troops like vamonos
i'm on this tour bus and i'm fucked up
i got a bad call, and it's all bad
of og with my og and some oe, but the tall glass

turnt up in this bitch and i'm beamin' and shit
hundred hoes, hundred fold, this my season and shit
stomach on belly roll, bitch i'm eatin' and shit
you a vegan and shit, get off my penis and shit
look a bad bitch, i back that bitch nigga back back
pull it out the grab bag, turn this ho to baghdad
bags on my eyes, i don't sleep much, we up
bitch i beat the beat up, the homies get you beat up
and rip to p-nut, little eric, get back
mausberg, 4 bent, compton i live that
long hair weave with exten-sions
glock 17 with exten-sion
bumpin' suga free in the automatic dually
tv's in it like it's '97, watch a porno movie
holla chitty chitty bang, this is com-town gang
fuck whoever don't like it, lil' k-dot be the name, bitch
